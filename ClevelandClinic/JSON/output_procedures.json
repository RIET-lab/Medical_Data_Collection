Your surgeon will learn more about:\n*Your general health.\n*Your health history.\n*Any previous surgeries.\n*Any medications and supplements you currently take.\n*Your goals and expectations for the procedure.\nAfter learning more about you, your surgeon will explain what tummy tuck options work for your situation. Your provider will take photographs of your abdominal area to compare the before and after results of your procedure.\nSmoking tobacco products can increase the risk of complications and delay healing. If you smoke, you\u2019ll have to stop for a certain period your provider sets. For example, you may need to stop using tobacco products for at least one month before surgery and for at least two weeks after.\nYour surgeon will also recommend you eat well-balanced, complete meals leading up to and after the procedure. Achieving proper nutrition can help your body heal.\nAs part of your preoperative consultation, your surgeon may instruct you to stop taking certain blood-thinning medications and dietary supplements for a certain period before and after the surgery. This includes aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs). Don\u2019t stop taking any medications unless a healthcare provider approves it.\nYou\u2019ll also receive information to help you plan for surgery and recovery. You may need to:\n*Ask someone to drive you to and from the procedure and help you out at home.\n*Move frequently used items in your home to be within arm\u2019s reach.\n*Choose clothing to wear that\u2019s loose and comfortable.\n*Use a hand-held shower head to bathe or use a bathroom chair for comfort.\nYour surgeon will answer any questions you might have to give you more comfort and ease presurgery anxiety.",

Your surgeon may choose to perform liposuction as part of a tummy tuck.\n*Panniculectomy: A panniculectomy removes hanging skin and fat from your lower abdominal region. This procedure doesn\u2019t tighten muscles, move your belly button or address fullness in your upper abdomen.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nEveryone wants to feel and look their best, but sometimes, our bodies need a little help getting there. It\u2019s common to consider plastic surgery after undergoing significant changes, like growing your family or shrinking your waistband. A tummy tuck procedure is a great option if you\u2019d like to flatten and smooth out your abdominal area.

                    "body": "There are two ways that healthcare providers can perform ablation for kidney cancer:\n*Laparoscopically: Urologists perform ablation with this approach. Your surgeon makes small incisions and uses a laparoscope (video camera device) to deliver the treatment. This is a minimally invasive surgical procedure. You\u2019ll receive general anesthesia.\n*Percutaneously: Interventional radiologists perform ablation with this approach. These medical doctors specialize in treating conditions with the aid of imaging equipment. Your provider inserts the ablation probe through a small puncture in your numbed skin and uses imaging to find the kidney tumor for ablation. You may receive local anesthesia and/or a sedative.\nDuring ablation for kidney cancer, your provider:\n*Numbs your skin, or gives you a sedative or general anesthesia.\n*May place a ureteral stent, as there\u2019s a small risk that the temperature changes from the ablation can cause a urine leak or blockage. This stent allows urine to flow from your kidney to your bladder and out through a Foley catheter during the procedure.\n*Uses a needle to remove a piece of the tumor for a biopsy. They send it to a pathology lab, and you\u2019ll receive the information about five to seven days after your ablation. This tells your provider what type of kidney tumor you had, which can guide future management and monitoring strategies.\n*Inserts the ablation probe through a small incision or puncture. If you\u2019re having this procedure with laparoscopy, you\u2019ll have a few small incisions for the camera, probe and other instruments.\n*Activates the probe, generating extreme hot or cold temperatures at the tip of the device.\n*Looks at real-time images from an ultrasound, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT scan (computed tomography scan) to destroy the cancerous tissue.",

Adrenal disorders that can cause an overproduction of hormones include hyperaldosteronism, pheochromocytoma and Cushing syndrome.\nIn many cases, surgeons can do laparoscopic adrenalectomy (which requires one to four small incisions) instead of open surgery (which requires a large incision across your belly). Depending on your specific situation, a surgeon may remove one adrenal gland (unilateral adrenalectomy) or both adrenal glands (bilateral adrenalectomy). They can also remove certain types of adrenal tumors without removing your entire adrenal gland (partial adrenalectomy).",

Then, they place tiny surgical instruments through the incisions and remove your adrenal gland(s) with the help of a 2D camera. In most cases, surgeons do adrenalectomies laparoscopically.\n*Robotic adrenalectomy: Like laparoscopic surgery, this approach requires one to four small incisions in your abdomen. But instead of doing the surgery by hand, a surgeon uses a computer console and a 3D camera to remove your adrenal gland(s).\n*Open adrenalectomy: This traditional approach requires one long incision across your abdomen. A surgeon might choose this method to remove larger tumors measuring over 5.9 inches (15 centimeters) in size or if you have adrenocortical carcinoma.\nDuring a consultation with your healthcare provider, they\u2019ll review these options with you and determine which one is best for your situation.\nOn average, an adrenalectomy takes about two to three hours to complete.",

Healthcare providers sometimes call it ankle arthrodesis.\nJoints are any place in your body where two bones meet. Your ankle joint connects your foot to your lower leg. Specifically, it\u2019s where your shin bone (tibia) and calf bone (fibula) meet your ankle bone (talus).\nSurgeons most commonly use ankle fusion to treat severe ankle arthritis. If arthritis has worn away the cartilage that cushions and lubricates your ankle, the bones will rub against each other. Over time, this can damage your joint and become extremely painful. Your surgeon will fuse the bones in your ankle joint together to become one bone. This will reduce the extra friction inside your ankle and relieve the pain.\nA healthcare provider will usually suggest ankle fusion after other, nonsurgical treatments haven\u2019t worked for you. Fusion can relieve severe pain, stiffness and other symptoms that make it hard to move and use your ankle.",

Tell your providers if ankle pain or other symptoms make day-to-day activities hard, or if it\u2019s bad enough to make you avoid certain activities.\nBefore your surgery date, you\u2019ll need:\n*A physical exam to make sure you\u2019re healthy enough for surgery.\n*Blood tests.\n*Imaging tests, including an X-ray. You might also need an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT scan (computed tomography scan).\nTell your provider and surgeon all the medications and over-the-counter (OTC) or herbal supplements you take. You may have to stop taking some medications or supplements before your surgery.\nYour surgeon will tell you when you should fast the day before your surgery.

That means your surgeon will make incisions (cuts) in your skin to operate on your ankle joint. If you have an open ankle fusion, your surgeon will:\n*Make incisions in the skin around your ankle joint.\n*Remove any damaged cartilage and bone.\n*Insert screws, plates or both into your ankle bones to join them together.\n*Secure the fasteners in place, then close the incisions.\nSome people have ankle fusions done via an ankle arthroscopy. This is a minimally invasive technique. Your surgeon will make smaller incisions in your ankle than open surgery. Then, they\u2019ll insert a special tool called an arthroscope into your ankle. The arthroscope includes a camera and a light that lets your surgeon see what\u2019s going on inside your ankle.\nThe steps will be the same, it just depends on which surgery technique is right for you.",

Because the bones have been joined to become one, you won\u2019t be able to move your ankle as much after surgery. You\u2019ll still be able to move your heel from side to side, and the middle and front parts of your foot up and down. Even with the reduced range of motion in your fused ankle, the benefit outweighs the risk for most people who have severe ankle pain.\nHaving an ankle fusion can increase the risk you develop arthritis in other joints in your foot after surgery because the fusion can put more stress on these joints than before your surgery.\nSome people need additional surgeries (revisions) in the future.\nTalk to your surgeon about your risk of complications. They\u2019ll help you understand any potential risks and decide if joint fusion is your best treatment option."

        "Introduction": "Healthcare providers use apheresis to obtain or remove specific parts of blood to treat a wide range of conditions. In apheresis, a centrifuge machine removes blood from your body. You may participate in apheresis so you can donate blood elements to help others. But apheresis may also treat certain medical conditions by removing blood elements.",

                    "question": "What is apheresis?",
                    "body": "Apheresis is a procedure that enables healthcare providers to obtain or remove red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets and plasma for medical treatment. It\u2019s also known as pheresis or hemapheresis.\nIn apheresis, a centrifuge machine draws blood from your body and spins the blood to separate its elements. The machine sets aside certain elements and returns the remaining blood cells, platelets and plasma to your body.\nThere are two reasons why you may participate in apheresis: You\u2019re donating blood elements, like red blood cells, for someone else to use, or you\u2019re receiving treatment for a medical condition. For example, providers may use apheresis to remove abnormal blood elements. Different apheresis types include:\n*Leukapheresis: Providers do this treatment to remove white blood cells from your blood. The treatment eases symptoms that happen if your white blood cells are multiplying uncontrollably.\n*Peripheral blood stem cell collection: In this case, providers use apheresis to obtain immature stem cells for stem cell transplant.\n*Photopheresis: Healthcare providers treat several conditions with photopheresis. This procedure changes your lymphocytes so they can do more to fight intruders like cancerous cells and foreign viruses and bacteria. During photopheresis, a centrifuge machine removes lymphocytes and treats them with UVA light before they\u2019re returned to you.\n*Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange): Providers use plasmapheresis to treat several serious medical conditions through a process called plasma exchange.\n*Platelet depletion: Platelets help your blood to form clots. High platelet counts may cause complications like clotting or bleeding. If you have excess platelets, providers will do platelet depletion to remove platelets before returning blood to you.\n*Red blood cell exchange transfusion: Healthcare providers use apheresis to remove unhealthy red blood cells and replace them with healthy donated red blood cells.",

Don\u2019t hesitate to let them know if you don\u2019t feel comfortable or think apheresis is causing issues. Potential risks or complications may include:\n*Allergic reactions: Some people may be allergic to plasma or red blood cells that providers use to replace blood cells during apheresis.\n*Bleeding: Sometimes, the process of inserting a needle into a blood vessel to obtain blood causes excessive bleeding.\n*Blood clots: People with underlying conditions like cancer, diabetes or cardiovascular disease are at risk for blood clots.\n*Electrolyte imbalance: Electrolytes are minerals in your body that support important body functions. Your electrolyte levels may go up or down during apheresis.\n*Fluid overload: Rarely, too much fluid returns to your body during apheresis, causing swelling.\n*Hypocalcemia: This happens when your blood calcium levels drop during apheresis because the machine uses anticoagulants to remove blood.\n*Infection: Rarely, infection happens from needle insertion.\n*Low blood pressure (hypotension): Apheresis decreases the amount of blood in your body (blood volume). When you have less blood circulating through your body, your blood pressure may drop. Your blood pressure may drop because of anticoagulants that providers use to keep blood from clotting during apheresis. It may also drop due to vasodilation.\n*Nerve damage: Occasionally, inserting a needle or catheter damages nerves and causes numbness, tingling or weakness.",

The scope has a tiny light and camera at the end to guide the procedure.\n*Place a grounding pad near your body to protect you from the electrical current.\n*Use a catheter to insert an argon plasma coagulation device through the scope and thread it to the appropriate place inside your body.\n*Release argon gas through the catheter and then ignite it using the electrical current.\n*Adjust the position of the catheter and the levels of argon gas and electrical current, as needed.\n*Remove the scope, catheter and grounding pad when finished.\nArgon plasma coagulation usually takes 15 minutes to an hour.",

You might also need magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or a computed tomography (CT) scan.\nTell your provider and surgeon all the medications and over-the-counter (OTC) or herbal supplements you take.

Like other PAP devices, ASVs work by delivering pressurized air through tubing into a mask that you wear when you\u2019re sleeping. The flow of pressurized air keeps your airways open.\nASVs are different in that they deliver pressurized air on demand. Different PAP types deliver pressurized air in different ways. For example, a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine sends a steady flow of air. If you use an ASV machine, the machine measures your breathing patterns and customizes the flow of air needed to stabilize your breathing. The machine has built-in sensors that track your breathing so the machine can adjust airflow levels.",

                            "body": "Healthcare providers may prescribe ASVs to treat central sleep apnea (CSA) or complex CSA. Complex CSA is when you have a combination of obstructive sleep apnea and CSA. Providers may recommend ASV to treat complex CSA when other forms of treatment have failed. They\u2019ll do a titration study (sleep study) to determine the exact air pressure that you\u2019ll need and use that information to set airflow levels on your ASV.\nIf you have CSA, there are long pauses when you don\u2019t take a breath, or your breathing rate is slower than normal. CSA happens when something keeps your brain from managing your breathing as it normally would. Central sleep apnea may happen because:\n*You take opioid pain medications.\n*You\u2019re age 60 or older.\n*You have a heart condition like congestive heart failure or atrial fibrillation (Afib).\n*You have a neurologic condition like stroke or congenital (present at birth) central nervous system issues. Your brain and spinal cord make up your central nervous system.\n*You have certain inherited disorders like Rett syndrome or Prader-Willi syndrome.\n*You have hypoxia (low blood oxygen levels) because you live or are traveling in high altitudes over 8,500 feet (around 2,951 meters) from sea level.",

        "Introduction": "An autologous stem cell transplant may be a treatment option for some blood cancers. It works by using your own healthy stem cells to replace cells that cancer treatment kills. It may be an option when other treatments aren\u2019t effective, or cancer comes back. Research shows it may put a specific blood cancer into long-term remission.",

                    "body": "An autologous (pronounced \u201cah-tah-luh-gus\u201d) stem cell transplant uses your own blood stem cells to restore your bone marrow\u2019s ability to make the cells. It\u2019s treatment for some types of blood cancer.\nIn an autologous stem cell transplantation, your healthcare team removes healthy blood stem cells before you receive high doses of chemotherapy to kill cancerous cells. You may also receive radiation therapy.\nThe same treatment that gets rid of cancerous cells also kills healthy cells. It can also damage your bone marrow so it stops making blood cells. An autologous stem cell transplant is how you receive healthy blood stem cells so your bone marrow can make new, healthy blood cells.\nThis procedure may not cure cancer. But research shows it can put cancer into long-term remission, meaning you don\u2019t have symptoms and tests don\u2019t find signs of cancer. It\u2019s also an option when other treatments don\u2019t work (refractory cancer) or the cancer comes back (recurrent cancer).",

Here are some suggestions that may help you along the road to recovery:\n*Get rest: You may have days when it\u2019s exhausting to make it through your day. Rest when you need to, not just when you think you can.\n*Eat well: Your body needs to recover from conditioning treatment, and meals packed with protein will help. Ask to speak with a nutritionist if you want to make sure you\u2019re getting enough nutrients.\n*Make regular physical activity part of your day: As you feel stronger, you can start doing things like taking a walk. But be sure to talk to your provider before starting anything new, and don\u2019t push yourself once you start.\n*Update your vaccinations: An autologous stem cell transplant will wipe out any protection from your past vaccinations, including your childhood vaccinations.

They may recommend that you stop taking any medications that increase your risk of bleeding during your bladder surgery, including:\n*Aspirin.\n*Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n*Blood thinners (anticoagulants).\n*Certain herbal supplements.\nDon\u2019t stop taking any medications unless the provider tells you.\nTell the provider about all your allergies, as well. These include:\n*Drug allergies.\n*Skin cleaner allergies, like iodine or isopropyl alcohol.\n*Latex allergy.\n*Food allergies.\nA provider may also ask you to stop smoking and using tobacco products. Tobacco use increases health risks during and after surgery, including slowing down the healing process and decreasing your immune system\u2019s effectiveness.\nYou\u2019ll likely receive specific directions on eating and drinking before bladder surgery. This may include following a clear liquid eating pattern eight to 12 hours before your surgery. Clear liquids include juices without pulp, soup broth and gelatin (Jell-O\u00ae).",

Robotic surgery reduces healing time, scarring and other risk factors.\n*Open surgery. A surgeon will use a sharp knife (scalpel) to make one long cut (incision) in your abdomen (belly) to access your bladder. They\u2019ll insert their hands through the incision to perform the procedure. Open surgery is rare.\n*Endoscopic surgery. A surgeon will use a long camera (endoscope) through your urethra to access to your bladder. There are no incisions with this surgery.\nWhen you talk to a healthcare provider about bladder surgery, feel free to ask lots of questions.

They\u2019ll also create a surgical opening (stoma) in your abdomen. You\u2019ll occasionally empty the pouch with a suprapubic catheter that you insert into your stoma.\n*Ileal conduit. The surgeon will disconnect a small section of your small intestine, attach it to one end of your ureters (tubes that carry pee from your kidneys to your bladder) and attach the other end of your ureter to a stoma. Your pee collects in a plastic bag (ostomy bag) that you place over your stoma.\n*Neobladder. The surgeon makes a new bladder (neobladder) out of your small intestine to store and remove pee. The neobladder exists in the same location in your body as your original bladder, and your pee exits your body through your urethra.",

You may have to use a catheter to drain pee out of your body through a stoma. If you have a neobladder, pee comes out of your body the same way that it would with your original, healthy bladder.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nBladder surgery is a common type of surgery to help treat conditions that affect your bladder and urinary system. A surgeon may need to replace part or all of your bladder. You may need to adjust to changes, including a new way to drain pee from your body. However, many people can still enjoy the same activities they did before bladder surgery. Your surgeon will explain what type of surgery you\u2019ll need and give you instructions on how you can help your body heal and adjust to any new changes."

This process relies on stem cells and growth factors, making bone marrow an excellent source of them.\nHealthcare providers harvest them in a procedure called bone marrow aspiration: They draw a sample of the liquid part of your bone marrow through a hollow needle. The sample is called bone marrow aspirate.\nThey produce bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) by processing and distilling this sample.

Stem cells are cells in their raw form before they specialize to become different types of tissues.\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the type of stem cells that replenish soft tissues, cartilage and bone. They\u2019re less abundant in bone marrow than other types, so a concentrated dose is more likely to help.\nBMAC also promotes healing by reducing inflammation and scarring (fibrosis). Severe or long-lasting inflammation can lead to scarring. While scarring is a type of healing, it\u2019s not the same as regenerating.\nScar tissue is dense, fibrous tissue that may not have the same blood supply, flexibility or functionality as the original tissue.

Biologics are therapeutics derived from organic life \u2014 in this case, from your own body.\nWhile BMAC comes from your bone marrow, platelet-rich plasma is a blood product drawn from a vein. Processing concentrates the platelets in the blood sample \u2014 the clotting factors that help seal wounds.\nLike BMAC, PRP contains growth factors and anti-inflammatory agents that can help encourage tissue healing and reduce discomfort. But PRP doesn\u2019t contain live mesenchymal stem cells like BMAC does.\nBoth have shown benefits for treating musculoskeletal conditions, but BMAC offers greater potential for tissue regeneration because of the stem cells it contains. Some providers suggest using both together.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nBone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) is still a new and experimental therapy. Healthcare providers are still discovering its full potential for treating musculoskeletal conditions and how best to apply it.\nBut for those who live with chronic wounds or degenerative joint diseases that haven\u2019t responded to other treatments, potential means a lot. Injections are a simple way to see what BMAC could do for you.",

There may also be a burning sensation with passing urine. These side effects usually become less noticeable over the next six to eight weeks.\n*You may have some slight bleeding. Contact your provider if you\u2019re bleeding more than you expect or if you see large clots of blood in your pee.\nLong-term side effects\n*Erectile dysfunction: Research suggests 25% of people who have this treatment develop erectile dysfunction (trouble maintaining an erection). It\u2019s important to remember that prostate cancer typically affects people age 50 and older and that people often live for many years after treatment. You could develop erectile dysfunction that\u2019s not related to your prostate cancer treatment.\n*Radiation exposure: The radioactive implants in your prostate will give off very small amounts of radiation. You may worry that you\u2019ll spread radiation to other people, particularly small children or pregnant people. They may be around you as much as they like, but you should limit the amount of time that they sit in your lap. In general, it\u2019s a good idea not to have a small child or pregnant person sit on your lap for more than 20 minutes at a time for two months after your procedure. But everyone\u2019s situation is different. Ask your radiation oncologist for guidance.\n*Radiation proctitis: This condition is an uncommon complication. It affects less than 3% of people who have radiation in their pelvic area, including the prostate. Radiation proctitis causes bleeding and inflammation in your rectum after radiation therapy.\n*Radiation cystitis: You may notice blood in your pee. This doesn\u2019t happen very often \u2014 less than 3% of people who have brachytherapy for prostate cancer experience radiation cystitis \u2014 but you should contact your provider if it happens.",

This usually means placing valves in just one lung, in the area that\u2019s most damaged.\nThe valves allow air to escape when you breathe out, but they don\u2019t let air into the same area when you breathe in.

                    "body": "A BTT shunt operation, or Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt, is a procedure to help babies who aren\u2019t getting enough oxygen. This can happen because of a congenital (present at birth) heart condition.\nInfants with certain types of heart issues have trouble getting blood to their pulmonary artery, which takes blood to their lungs. When blood goes to your lungs, it picks up oxygen from the air you breathe into your lungs.\nA Blalock-Taussig-Thomas shunt is a short-term solution for babies until they grow and develop enough to have a more permanent surgery. During that later operation, a surgeon will remove the BTT shunt and do a more permanent repair. Surgeons usually perform a BTT shunt procedure during a baby\u2019s first few days of life.\nFor some babies, a BTT shunt is the only solution that works in their situation, even in the long term.\nHealthcare providers called this a BT shunt or Blalock-Taussig shunt in the past. The extra \u201cT\u201d for \u201cThomas\u201d now recognizes a third contributor who helped develop the procedure in the 1940s.",

But it does this without sacrificing how much blood it can supply to your arm (which is one of its functions). It also gives a surgeon more flexibility in connecting the two arteries.",

                    "body": "On the day of your surgery, you\u2019ll receive anesthesia to make sure you don\u2019t feel any pain. You won\u2019t usually need general anesthesia to put you to sleep during a bunionectomy. An anesthesiologist may use a few different types of anesthesia that numb you anywhere from the waist down or just your foot and the area around it.\nWhat happens during your surgery depends on which type you need. There are four main types of bunion surgery:\n*Osteotomy: Your surgeon will make a few small incisions (cuts) in your foot and toe bones. They\u2019ll insert screws or pins into your bones to realign your big toe joint. This is one of the most common types of bunion surgery. It\u2019s becoming more common for surgeons to do minimally invasive osteotomy with smaller incisions, faster recovery times and less scarring.\n*Arthrodesis (joint fusion): Your surgeon might perform a joint fusion if arthritis in your foot and toe caused the bunion or if you have a severe bunion. They\u2019ll remove any parts of your big toe joint that have arthritis. Then, your surgeon will place screws into the bones to hold them together. The bones will join together (fuse) into one bone as they heal. Surgeons usually only do joint fusions on the most severe bunions.\n*Lapidus: Your surgeon will remove the bunion. Then, they\u2019ll realign your foot by fusing the joint between your first metatarsal bone (the long bone in the middle of your foot) and the medial cuneiform (one of the small bones where your ankle meets your foot). Your surgeon may suggest the Lapidus procedure if you have a severe bunion. It\u2019s also a good option for people with hypermobility in their foot (the bunion makes your toe move too far or become unstable) and younger people with bunions.\n*Exostectomy: During this surgery, your surgeon will shave off the bunion. Surgeons will often perform an osteotomy at the same time to reposition your toe. Exostectomy is rare because surgeons can usually only do it on the most minor bunions. Most people who need bunion surgery have a bunion that\u2019s severe enough to need another type of bunionectomy.",

More specifically, the injection goes into the space around your spinal nerves known as the epidural space. A CESI is a specific type of epidural steroid injection (ESI).\nThe injection can help treat pain caused by irritation and inflammation of your spinal nerve roots. Healthcare providers use CESIs as a\u00a0chronic pain\u00a0management tool for lower back pain.\n\u201cCaudal\u201d means \u201ctoward the tail.\u201d For a CESI, the path of the needle is through your sacral hiatus. This is toward the bottom of your sacrum and just above your tailbone (coccyx). It\u2019s the path to reach the lowest spinal nerves. Your sacrum is the triangular bone in your lower back that\u2019s situated between your hip bones.\nThe thought of getting an injection near your spinal cord may be nerve-wracking. But caudal epidural steroid injections are generally safe procedures and may be a minimally invasive way to get pain relief. To ensure your safety, make sure you get the injection from a healthcare provider who performs this procedure often.",

                    "body": "In most cases, a caudal epidural steroid injection involves the following steps:\n*You change into a medical gown and lie face-down on an X-ray table. You may use a pillow under your abdomen for increased comfort.\n*A healthcare provider cleans (disinfects) the area of your back where the injection will go.\n*A provider injects a local anesthetic (numbing medication) into the skin of your lower back. This is so you won\u2019t experience pain from the epidural steroid injection.\n*A provider uses a needle to inject contrast dye into the epidural space around your spinal cord in your lower back. This dye helps your tissues show up better in imaging.\n*A provider uses several pulses (brief bursts) of an X-ray beam to see the tissues in your lower back. This is called fluoroscopy. This imaging guidance helps your provider see exactly where the medicine should go.\n*Using a needle, your provider injects steroid medication into your epidural space. You may feel some pressure during the injection. It\u2019s important not to move during the procedure.\n*Once your provider removes the needle, they\u2019ll place a sterile dressing over the site.\nThe entire process usually takes only 15 to 30 minutes. After the procedure, a provider will monitor you for 15 to 20 minutes before you can go home.",

Side effects of caudal epidural steroid injections may include:\n*A temporary increase in pain before the steroid medication starts working.\n*Tenderness and/or bruising at the site of the injection.\n*If you have diabetes, an epidural steroid injection (ESI) will likely cause\u00a0high blood sugar\u00a0(hyperglycemia). This could last for hours or even days.\n*If you have\u00a0glaucoma, an ESI may temporarily increase your\u00a0blood pressure\u00a0and eye pressure.\nCaudal epidural steroid injections are usually safe, but they come with certain risks and complications. Although rare, risks and complications may include:\n*Low blood pressure, which can make you feel lightheaded.\n*Infection.\n*Bleeding around your spinal column. This could cause a hematoma or a\u00a0blood clot\u00a0to form.\n*Allergic reaction to the medication.\n*Spinal headache due to spinal fluid leakage. Less than 1% of people experience this complication.\n*Nerve damage.\n*Temporarily losing the ability to regulate your bladder and bowels (incontinence). You might need a catheter (a small tube) to help you pee.\nGetting epidural steroid injections too often or receiving higher doses of steroid medication may weaken your spinal bones or nearby muscles. Because of this, most healthcare providers limit people to two to three ESIs per year.",

Cheek fillers may be a better option for you depending on your goals. People with certain health conditions, such as blood disorders, may not be good candidates for surgery and may prefer fillers.\nIf you\u2019re considering cheek implants vs. fillers, keep in mind that dermal fillers are temporary. The changes to your cheeks depend on which filler your healthcare provider uses and how much of it they use. Generally, the effects of cheek fillers can last anywhere from six months to several years. Cheek implants are permanent.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nCheek implants can give your cheeks a more defined, youthful look. Cheek implant surgery usually takes an hour or less and has a relatively short recovery. However, as with any cosmetic surgery, risks are possible. For the best results, find a plastic surgeon who has expertise in performing cheek implant surgery. To see if you\u2019re a candidate for cheek implants, talk to a plastic surgeon.",

Your healthcare provider may ask the following questions:\n*Why do you want a cheek lift?\n*What are your expectations?\n*Have you had plastic surgery before?\n*Is a spouse, partner or friend encouraging you to get a cheek lift?\nYour healthcare provider will evaluate your general health by performing a physical exam. They\u2019ll also discuss any preexisting conditions or risk factors that may affect the outcome of the procedure.\nTalk to your healthcare provider about any allergies you have. Tell them about any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications that you\u2019re taking, including herbal supplements. Aspirin, anti-inflammatory drugs and certain herbal supplements can increase your risk of bleeding.\nYour surgeon may add or adjust what medications you currently take to help you prepare for surgery.

A healthcare provider gives you a sedative to calm you and an anesthetic to prevent pain. You\u2019re awake and aware of your surroundings, but you may not be able to talk.\nAfter you get an anesthetic, your plastic surgeon will make an incision (cut) in your skin. Then, they\u2019ll insert a small endoscopic camera to see inside your cheek.

Nonsurgical cheek lift procedures, including botulinum toxin injections and dermal fillers, wear off within three months to 18 months.\n*Quick procedure and recovery. A cheek lift may offer a much shorter procedure and healing time compared to a traditional facelift.\n*Safety. A cheek lift is a relatively safe procedure with a low risk of complications or side effects.\n*Self-esteem boost. A youthful appearance can help restore confidence and satisfaction.\n*Low risk of visible scarring. Your hairline, facial hair or the natural outlines or edges (contours) of your face typically hide any incision scars.",

You may notice:\n*Swelling and bruising.\n*Pain or soreness.\n*Light bleeding from the incision site.\nYou can ease minimal bruising and swelling in the first 24 to 48 hours after the procedure with ice. Apply a bag of ice or an ice pack covered in a light towel over your affected areas for at least 10 minutes. Apply ice at least four times a day.\nAfter seven to 10 days, your pain should decrease. Some people take either a prescribed pain medication or over-the-counter (OTC) acetaminophen to manage pain. Discuss your allergies and complete medical history with your provider before taking any pain medications.\nAvoid physical activity for at least two weeks, including bending over, lifting heavy objects and running. It\u2019s also a good idea to avoid turning your head quickly. Slowly turn your head with your shoulders \u2014 not your neck \u2014 until you heal completely.\nYou may experience swelling around your cheeks that can last up to six weeks.

A traditional facelift tightens the muscles and other structures underneath your skin in your face and neck. They\u2019ll also remove excess fat and reposition your skin naturally. A cheek lift has a shorter procedure duration and healing time vs. a facelift.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nGetting a cheek lift is a personal decision. If you wish to make your cheek areas look younger and smoother, talk to a plastic surgeon to discuss your options. A cheek lift can boost your confidence, but you should be aware that the results last about 10 years, so you may need to get a cheek lift several times throughout your life. A cheek lift also won\u2019t address areas outside your midface, so you may need to combine it with other cosmetic procedures to meet your goals. Talk to your healthcare provider about your questions and concerns, and learn more about the outcomes and risks."

                    "body": "Gallbladder removal changes the structure of your biliary tract, which affects how your digestive system works. Your gallbladder usually stores extra bile until your small intestine needs it. It contracts to deliver the extra bile when you have a heavy meal to digest. After your cholecystectomy, bile will simply flow directly to your small intestine from your liver, where it\u2019s made, without being stored first.\nMost people experience a temporary adjustment period in their digestive systems after gallbladder removal. For the first month or so, you might have more trouble digesting fats and heavier meals. This should gradually improve over time. Most people are able to resume a normal, healthy diet after their recovery. A small number of people develop longer-term digestive difficulties, for unclear reasons."

                    "body": "If you need to have your gallbladder removed, you could have a:\n*Laparoscopic cholecystectomy.\n*Robotic cholecystectomy.\n*Open cholecystectomy.\nMore than 90% of cholecystectomy procedures in the U.S. today are laparoscopic. Surgeons prefer this method most of the time because it\u2019s less invasive, causing less pain and bleeding and leading to a quicker and easier recovery. Robotic cholecystectomy is a variation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy that select hospitals might offer. In robotic surgery, your surgeon operates the robotic instruments from a console.\nAn open cholecystectomy is the traditional method for removing your gallbladder. It means that your surgeon opens up your abdomen by making one long incision to access your gallbladder. An open cholecystectomy is still a relatively simple and safe procedure, and in certain circumstances, it might be safer. Surgeons sometimes need open access to manage more urgent or complicated conditions.",

Your healthcare provider will explain the nature of your condition and why they recommend the procedure, and you\u2019ll have time to think about it, choose when to have it and prepare. In other circumstances, cholecystectomy is an emergency procedure that occurs without a lot of lead time.\nYour healthcare team will:\n*Make sure you\u2019re in a fit condition for surgery. This might involve blood tests and other general health screenings. If you aren\u2019t well enough for surgery, you might have an alternative procedure instead, like a cholecystostomy. You might have a cholecystectomy later on.\n*Explain the procedure and why they want to do it. They\u2019ll ask for your informed consent. They\u2019ll let you know if they\u2019re planning an open or laparoscopic cholecystectomy, although sometimes this plan changes. A laparoscopic procedure sometimes needs to convert to open surgery.\n*Plan ahead, if possible. If they can schedule your surgery in advance, they\u2019ll ask you to prepare by not smoking, not eating and not taking certain medications in the hours beforehand. These preparations help to prevent certain surgery complications and make surgery safer for you.\n*Prepare you for surgery. When you\u2019re ready for surgery, your team will install an IV line in your arm to deliver fluids and medications. You\u2019ll have general anesthesia for the procedure. Once you\u2019re unconscious, your team will install a breathing tube to help keep your airway open.",

It can go through your peritoneum, a membrane that covers your gallbladder, or through your liver, which sits on top of your gallbladder. These routes have different pros and cons, depending on your anatomy and related health conditions. Your healthcare provider will weigh these factors to decide the best route.\nThe two types of operations are called:\n*Percutaneous transperitoneal cholecystostomy.\n*Percutaneous transhepatic cholecystostomy.",

Don\u2019t immerse it in the bath and use a plastic covering when you shower. Change the dressing daily, cleaning up any fluid secretions around the tube. If the tube loosens from your skin, secure it with tape and contact your provider.\n*Tube flushing: Your healthcare team will instruct you on how to flush your tube each day. This helps to prevent blockages and bacterial infections. You\u2019ll disconnect the tube from the drainage bag and inject the flush into the tube with a syringe. The flush is about 5 to 10 cc of sterile saline solution.\n*Bag emptying: While your tube is disconnected from your bag, you can empty the bag into the toilet by removing the cap and turning it upside down. Your healthcare provider might ask you to record your bile output before disposing of it. They\u2019ll want to know if your output suddenly increases or decreases."

One way is by clamping your tube for 24 to 48 hours to see if this causes any symptoms. Another common procedure is to take a cholangiogram, imaging of your biliary tract, to make sure your bile is flowing without obstruction before removing the tube.",

Placing a catheter is one common reason. When your gallbladder needs drainage through a catheter, it\u2019s usually under dire circumstances.

You can help promote healing and reduce the risk of infection by applying a petroleum-based ointment like Vaseline\u00ae, Aquaphor\u00ae or bacitracin to the penile skin for at least two to three weeks after surgery.\nYou should be able to sponge-bathe your child after a circumcision revision. But it\u2019s a good idea to avoid a full-body bath until at least two days after the procedure. Carefully wash the area with soap and warm water. Pat the area dry with a towel after the bath and reapply any ointments. Reapply ointments after each diaper change, as well.",

Many insurance companies consider a circumcision revision a cosmetic procedure and may not cover it unless there are documented health problems that relate to the original circumcision. But talk to a healthcare provider. They can give you an idea of whether a circumcision revision is medically necessary.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nCircumcision is a very common procedure. But sometimes, there can be complications that require a circumcision revision. As a parent, it can be frustrating to hear that your child may need a circumcision revision. The last thing you want to do is put your child through any additional pain or discomfort or expose them to other surgical risks. Talk to a urologist. They can best advise you on whether your child would benefit from a circumcision revision."

It\u2019s like a distinctive birthmark or tattoo you look for to identify someone. In COVID-19, it\u2019s a protein that sticks out all around the outside of the virus (the spike protein).\nThe first time an invader, like a virus or bacteria, enters your body, your immune system needs to look for the right tools (specific B-cells) to recognize the antigen and destroy the pathogen it belongs to. When your immune cells find the right tools, they make a lot of them to find and get rid of the infection. But this process can take some time.\nYou also have special cells that remember the pathogen (memory B-cells). Like taking a photo and putting it on a \u201cwanted\u201d poster, your immune cells can then patrol your body, looking for familiar pathogens. If they encounter one, they can destroy it much more quickly than the first time it infected you \u2014 often before it makes you sick at all. This is called adaptive immunity.\nCOVID vaccines aim to tell your body what SARS-CoV-2 looks like without actually getting an infection. Then your immune system can build up its tools and surveillance team, so when it sees the virus, it can fight it off quickly. For some people, this means they don\u2019t get sick at all if they\u2019re exposed to COVID. Other times, it makes their symptoms less severe and allows them to recover more quickly.",

This made COVID vaccine development faster than vaccines before it.\nNo matter which type of shot you get, your body breaks down the ingredients or they\u2019re destroyed by your immune system within a few days. This means vaccines can\u2019t cause long-lasting health effects.\nAll that being said, any vaccine or medication has a risk of side effects and allergic reactions, which can sometimes be severe. Serious health conditions as a result of COVID vaccination are very rare."

But decades of research went into developing the technology that now makes vaccines faster and easier to develop.\nResearch into mRNA technology dates back to the 1970s. Scientists first started applying it to vaccine development in the 1990s. It took over 20 years of research to learn how to get our immune systems to recognize the mRNA without destroying it too quickly, and how to get it into our cells.\nFinally, in 2018, the FDA approved patisiran (Onpattro\u00ae), a drug that treats a rare nerve disease. The method patisiran uses to deliver RNA (lipid nanoparticles) paved the way for Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech to use it in their COVID vaccines.",

The condition activates your platelets, part of your blood that helps it clot.\nAbout 1 in 250,000 people had TTS after getting Johnson & Johnson/Janssen or AstraZeneca\u00ae vaccines. Johnson & Johnson/Janssen and AstraZeneca COVID vaccines are no longer available, and AstraZeneca vaccines were never used in the U.S. Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines aren\u2019t associated with TTS.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nScientists were able to develop COVID vaccines in record time thanks to decades of research in mRNA technology. Before the vaccines, millions of people were seriously ill or died of COVID-19. Hospitals were overflowing. Since the FDA authorized the first COVID vaccines in late 2020, over 270 million people (or 81% of the U.S. population) have received at least one dose. This has prevented millions of deaths and hospitalizations. The technology they use is promising for developing future vaccines quickly.",

The 19th-century German gynecologist and obstetrician Carl Cred\u00e9 originally developed the maneuver to help deliver the placenta during labor.\nThe Cred\u00e9 maneuver stimulates the detrusor muscle in your bladder. The detrusor muscle is a collection of smooth muscle fibers that squeeze or spasm to empty pee from your bladder. Sometimes, people can develop conditions that prevent the detrusor muscle from working as it should. The Cred\u00e9 maneuver helps stimulate the detrusor muscle to squeeze or put pressure on your bladder to force pee out.\nAnother name for the Cred\u00e9 maneuver is suprapubic pressure. \u201cSuprapubic\u201d means above the pelvis bones.",

A urinary catheter is a medical device that a healthcare provider inserts into your urethra and extends to your bladder. It drains pee into a bag outside of your body.\n*Self-catheterization. You insert a temporary urinary catheter through your urethra to your bladder and drain pee into the toilet. Take the catheter out immediately once you finish.\n*Medication. Medications can help treat conditions that cause urinary retention. These may include antibiotics to treat UTIs, alpha-blockers to help your prostate muscle relax and medicines that help shrink your prostate.\n*Surgery. Surgery can help treat kidney stones (including a ureteroscopy or shockwave lithotripsy), remove part or all of your prostate (prostatectomy), decrease the size of your prostate, or open or widen your urethra (urethral dilation).\n*Pelvic floor exercises. Kegel exercises and other pelvic floor therapies can help strengthen the muscles you use to pee. A pelvic floor physical therapist can help teach you pelvic floor exercises.",

Then, they use a laser or other ultrasound device to break the stones into small pieces for removal.\n*Percutaneous suprapubic cystolitholapaxy: Healthcare providers use this method when treating children with bladder stones because their urethras are narrower and it\u2019s harder to insert a cystoscope. It\u2019s also treatment for adults with larger bladder stones. The procedure requires one incision (cut) in the skin of your lower abdomen and one cut into your bladder.",

It\u2019s a good idea to avoid alcohol, driving or operating heavy machinery or signing any important documents in the first 24 hours after surgery due to leftover anesthesia still being in your system.\nSome people may have a catheter in their bladder after surgery to help them pee. This is a tube that takes pee from your bladder and transports it to a bag you wear outside of your body. It may stay in place for up to a week while your body heals, and then, your provider will remove it.\nOther self-care instructions may include:\n*Drink lots of water after surgery.\n*Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for mild pain according to the instructions on the label. Contact your healthcare provider if you experience pain that\u2019s unbearable or doesn\u2019t improve.\n*Take antibiotics if your provider prescribes them to you (to prevent infection).\n*Take time to rest for the first 24 to 48 hours.",

Your uterus needs to be completely empty after any of these events due to an increased risk of infection and bleeding.\n*Diagnosing or treating irregular uterine bleeding. A D&C can remove the abnormal tissue that causes medical conditions like infection, fibroids or uterine cancer. It can also remove a cyst, polyp or tumor. Your provider may send a sample of your uterine tissue to a lab for analysis (biopsy).\nSometimes, you have a D&C and\u00a0hysteroscopy. During this procedure, your provider inserts a video-like device into your cervix to see the inside of your uterus.

You\u2019re fully conscious with this type of anesthesia.\n*Local anesthesia, which means only your cervix is numb. You\u2019re awake and have feeling in all areas of your body other than your genital area.\nAfter you receive anesthesia, your provider will begin the procedure. The steps of a D&C generally go like this:\n*You lie on a table with your feet in stirrups, like during a\u00a0gynecologic exam.\n*Your healthcare provider inserts a speculum into your vagina. This device, shaped like a duck\u2019s bill, helps open your cervix. A clamp helps hold your cervix in place.\n*Your provider will use dilators, which are thin metal rods that start small and then gradually increase in diameter. The rods gently stretch your cervix until it\u2019s wide enough to accommodate the instruments your provider needs to complete the procedure.\n*Your provider uses a curette, a type of spoon-shaped scraping device, to clean out the tissue from your uterus. They sometimes use a thin suction device to get any remaining tissue.\n*They may send a sample of the tissue to a lab for analysis.",

The decision to have a D&C for any reason is a personal choice and one that is best made after talking to your healthcare provider.\nA D&C may be an option to end a pregnancy in the first trimester (up to about 13 weeks of pregnancy).\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nA D&C, or dilation and curettage, is a procedure to remove tissue from your uterus. Your healthcare provider can use a D&C and hysteroscopy to diagnose unexplained bleeding. So, it may help your provider find answers you\u2019ve sought for a long time. Or it may be the last step after an incomplete miscarriage or abortion. If you had a miscarriage or have bleeding between your periods, talk to your healthcare provider to see if you need a D&C."

They\u2019ll also disinfect the area where they\u2019ll draw a sample of your blood \u2014 usually your forearm or wrist.\n*You may receive a local anesthetic near where the blood patch will go to numb the area and minimize pain. This may be a patch or an injection.\n*A provider will insert an IV catheter with a needle into one of your blood vessels to be able to get a sample of your blood.\n*An anesthesiologist or radiologist will insert a needle into the epidural space near your spinal cord. They may use imaging guidance, like ultrasound, to locate the exact spot.\n*Right after this, a provider will collect a sample of your blood through the IV catheter.\n*The provider will slowly inject the blood into your epidural space over 30 to 60 seconds. You\u2019ll likely feel discomfort or cramping in the area as this happens. Let the anesthesiologist know what you\u2019re feeling.\n*After the injection, a provider will cover the area with a bandage.",

You may need to change some parts of your daily routine to increase the likelihood of a successful surgery.\nYou may need to:\n*Get imaging tests: You may need imaging procedures, including a computed tomography (CT) scan of your chest and abdomen, an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or a PET scan (positron emission tomography scan). These procedures allow your provider to locate the tissue that needs to be removed so they can plan for surgery.\n*Getting preliminary treatments: If you have esophageal cancer, you may need cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy before surgery. Studies show that getting these treatments beforehand leads to better long-term results for some people.\n*Ensure you\u2019re healthy enough for surgery: Managing conditions like diabetes and high blood pressure before surgery can reduce the risk of complications afterward. Your provider will also help you quit tobacco and nicotine products if you use them. Smoking slows the healing process.\n*Take steps to prepare for recovery: You may work with a dietitian to prepare for changes in your eating and drinking after having your esophagus removed. You may work with a speech-language pathologist (SLP) to learn exercises that strengthen your breathing muscles to prevent respiratory (lung) complications after surgery.\n*Plan your hospital stay: Plan to spend a week or two in the hospital. Pack must-have items, including practical ones (like your medications). Bring comfort items, like your favorite pillow and a good book.\n*Plan for home recovery: You\u2019ll need someone to drive you home from the hospital and help you while you recover. Rearrange things around your home so you can access essential items without straining to reach or carry them.\nIn the days leading up to your procedure, follow your provider\u2019s guidance on:\n*Which medicines to take: For example, you may need to avoid using blood thinners (including aspirin) before surgery.\n*When to start fasting: You may need to limit what you eat and drink before surgery. For example, you may need to switch from hard foods to a liquid diet before an esophagectomy.",

Your surgeon may place an epidural catheter into your back to help with pain management after surgery.\n*Depending on the procedure, your surgeon will make one or more cuts into your neck, chest or abdomen so they can access your esophagus.\n*Your surgeon will remove the diseased or damaged part of your esophagus. Often, they\u2019ll remove a smaller portion of your stomach. In severe cases, they may need to remove all of your stomach.\n*The surgeon will pull your stomach (or small intestine) up into your chest or neck area (depending on the surgery type) and reconnect it to the remaining esophagus.\n*If you have esophageal cancer, your surgeon will also remove lymph nodes to check them for cancer cells in a lab. Lymph nodes are glands that filter fluid or lymph. Having cancer cells in your lymph nodes means the cancer has spread outside your esophagus.\nRegardless of the type of esophagectomy, you\u2019ll need a feeding tube to provide nutrition as you recover your ability to swallow. Your surgeon will insert the tube into your stomach or small intestine.\nYou\u2019ll also have a nasogastric tube, a drain that goes in through your nose. This tube suctions out excess air in your stomach, which helps you heal. You may need chest drains to empty fluid that collects in your chest cavity, as well. This also helps you heal.",

Tiny pieces of the stones can then move through your urinary tract and out of your body more easily.\nKidney stones are rock-like masses that form when you have high levels of certain substances (like calcium) in your pee (urine). They form inside your kidneys but can move into your ureters (the tubes that carry urine to your bladder).\nMany kidney stones pass on their own \u2014 they move through your urinary tract and you pee them out. But sometimes, a kidney stone becomes too big to move through (or gets stuck inside). Pain during a \u201ckidney stone attack\u201d is typically due to a stone getting stuck in your ureter and blocking drainage of pee from your kidney.\nESWL can dislodge the stones and allow you to pass them on your own.",

ESWL usually works best to treat smaller stones.\n*The location of the stone.\n*Any health conditions you have or regular medications you take.\n*Your body type.

Less commonly, you may sit in a large tub of water.\n*Providers will use X-rays or ultrasound to pinpoint the stone\u2019s location. These images help providers aim shock waves as precisely as possible at the stone.\n*Your care team may move you slightly to line your body up with the energy beams.\n*A shock wave lithotripsy machine sends powerful energy waves through the water and into your body. If you\u2019re awake for the procedure, you may hear a popping sound or feel a tapping sensation along your side.\n*Thousands of shock waves are aimed at the kidney stone, breaking the stone into many pieces.",

It\u2019s a treatment for acute compartment syndrome, and it\u2019s usually an emergency procedure.\nFascia is a tough connective tissue that wraps around your muscles and other body parts. A group of muscles, nerves and blood vessels enclosed within a layer of fascia is called a muscle compartment.\nWhen there\u2019s too much swelling inside the compartment, it\u2019s extremely painful and can even cut off blood flow to the tissues, causing them to die. Fasciotomy relieves the pressure and restores blood flow.\nOccasionally, fasciotomy also treats chronic compartment syndrome. This is less often an emergency. Chronic compartment syndrome develops more gradually, but sometimes, it gradually becomes severe.",

They might have to release several compartments.\n*Examine the compartment for damage and remove any dead tissue. They\u2019ll watch to ensure the blood flow returns to your tissues, which will make color return and make them start to swell.\n*Allow the swelling to go down, which can take several days. In some cases, they might apply negative pressure wound therapy to pull some of the fluid from the wound and reduce swelling.\n*Reexamine the wound after a few days and remove additional dead tissue if needed.\n*Close the wound when the swelling has gone down enough. In some cases, they might use a skin graft from somewhere else on your body to close the wound, leaving more space for it.\n*Wrap the wound in a compression bandage. They\u2019ll tell you how long you need to wear it.",

If you\u2019re in the hospital and you get the diagnosis and the operation in time, it\u2019s almost always successful in saving your affected body part.\nThe longer you go without treatment, the less successful it\u2019s likely to be. After six hours, you\u2019re at an increased risk of permanent nerve damage. After 12 hours, the rate of complications rises steeply.\nFasciotomy for chronic compartment syndrome is less complicated because you usually aren\u2019t in poor health already when you have the operation. It\u2019s almost always successful in relieving chronic pain.\nChronic compartment syndrome usually happens when you overtrain or overuse your muscles.

But how do you find providers and hospital systems you can trust? The following can help:\n*Research your providers. You can look up providers\u2019 medical board and license information on your state\u2019s medical database or a national database.\n*Make sure you feel comfortable talking to your providers. Your providers\u2019 approach to your thoughts and feelings should be kind, respectful and understanding. They should give you a chance to ask questions and provide thoughtful answers. You should feel comfortable talking to them about your body and desires.\n*Find providers who have experience with feminizing bottom surgery. It\u2019s a good idea to seek out providers and hospital systems with a lot of experience with this procedure. The more experience they have, the better they are.\nProviders that can help you understand the risks, benefits and steps you must take before feminizing bottom surgery include:\n*Social worker. A social worker helps provide social services to you and your support system. They can also help discuss potential causes of stress you may encounter as part of your surgery and recovery.\n*Psychologist. A psychologist is a mental health professional. Gender dysphoria isn\u2019t a mental health condition, and talking to a psychologist doesn\u2019t mean you have a mental health condition. But sometimes, mental health conditions \u2014 such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \u2014 can accompany dysphoria and may require treatment before surgery.\nYou must also meet the criteria from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). This includes:\n*Long-lasting, well-documented and professionally diagnosed gender dysphoria.\n*Ability to make a fully informed decision and permit healthcare providers to provide treatment (consent).\n*In some areas, you may need to be 18 or older.\n*Being in control of medical or mental health conditions.\n*Referrals or letters of recommendation from two qualified mental healthcare providers.\n*At least 12 ongoing months of feminizing hormone therapy.\nYour providers may also require the following:\n*Copies of your medical records, including letters of support.\n*A body mass index (BMI) less than 35.\n*You don\u2019t smoke or are able to quit smoking for at least four weeks. Smoking increases your risk of infection, slows your healing process and will affect your results.\n*You have a family member or close friend who can stay with you during the procedure and while you recover at the hospital and at home.\n*Laser hair removal or electrolysis on your genitals before surgery. These treatments help prevent hair growth in your vagina after surgery.\n*You have realistic expectations of the surgery, recovery and potential risks.",

During the vaginoplasty, your healthcare team will make sure your vagina has a good enough size and depth to allow for intercourse.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nFeminizing bottom surgery helps affirm your gender identity. Not every person who has gender dysphoria wants feminizing bottom surgery. But for some, it can ease emotional and psychological distress, boost your self-confidence and have other positive effects on your life. It\u2019s important to find providers with a lot of experience with this type of surgery and work with a mental health provider before and after the procedure. Working with trusted providers makes you more likely to be happy with your results."

This procedure opens up the foramen, or the opening in your vertebra bone where your nerve roots exit your spinal canal (the tube that holds your spinal cord). The nerves that exit your spinal canal through the foramen make up your peripheral nervous system.\nIf your foramen is narrow, you\u2019ll experience nerve pain and other symptoms that affect your movement.

These include:\n*Disorders affecting their nervous system.\n*Conditions affecting the anatomy of their head or mouth.\nThis exam is important because treating tongue-tie won\u2019t be enough to help if other factors affect your baby\u2019s ability to breastfeed. If your pediatrician determines tongue-tie is the main concern, they\u2019ll work with a lactation consultant to help you find solutions. For example, changing your breastfeeding position or adjusting your baby\u2019s latch may help.\nBut if your baby still can\u2019t breastfeed successfully, then your providers will talk to you about a frenotomy and what it involves. They\u2019ll make sure you\u2019re comfortable with the decision and explain the benefits and risks.",

This is the fold of tissue that connects the bottom of your baby\u2019s tongue to the floor of their mouth. Cutting this tissue allows your baby to move their tongue more freely.\nThe traditional method for a frenotomy uses scissors to cut (release) this tissue. This is the gold standard. However, some providers use other methods, like lasers. Researchers continue to compare the benefits and drawbacks of these various methods.\nInfants don\u2019t need anesthesia in any form for this procedure. Some healthcare providers recommend using oral sucrose (a sugar solution) before the procedure to help your baby feel more comfortable. Most babies are comforted afterward with feeding.\nFrenotomies typically take place in a provider\u2019s office or a hospital setting.",

Gamma Knife gets its name based on the precision of gamma rays. These are high-energy photons (a particle of electromagnetic radiation). Gamma rays are as accurate as a surgical knife to specifically target an area of your brain without cutting into your body.\nGamma Knife surgery is a type of\u00a0stereotactic radiosurgery.

They\u2019ll first perform a physical exam. During this exam, let your healthcare provider know if you have any medical implants like a pacemaker, cochlear implant, an implanted medication pump or nerve stimulator, among others.\nYour provider will ask if you have any allergies. They\u2019ll also ask you if you\u2019re able to lay flat on your back for 30 to 60 minutes, as it\u2019s required for the procedure. This can be difficult to do if you have lung disease or esophageal reflux.\nYou\u2019ll receive instructions to prepare for Gamma Knife surgery that are specific to your situation. In general, these instructions might include:\n*Don\u2019t eat or drink anything after midnight the evening before your procedure.\n*Take your morning medications with sips of water.\u00a0Bring all prescribed and over-the-counter (OTC) medications, including inhalers, with you.\n*Wash your scalp the night before your Gamma Knife procedure. Wear your hair loose. Don\u2019t use clips, pins or bands in your hair the day of your procedure.\n*Wear easy-to-remove shoes and comfortable, loose-fitting clothing. Avoid wearing a shirt that must be put on or taken off over your head.\n*You\u2019ll need to ask someone to drive you to and from your procedure.\nIf you have any questions, a good time to ask is during your pre-treatment exam.",

The mask secures to an existing frame on the Gamma Knife table, so your head is completely still.\nThese pieces of the Gamma Knife machine seem the most intimidating. The frame needs to attach to your skull, but don\u2019t worry \u2014 your provider will numb up that area. The mask or net rests on your face during the entire procedure.

                    "body": "On the day of your procedure, the following steps prepare you for a Gamma Knife procedure:\n*IV: You\u2019ll receive an IV in a vein in your arm. The IV delivers a contrast agent (a type of dye) that helps with imaging tests. The IV can also deliver a small amount of sedatives to help you relax if needed. General anesthesia might be an option for children (so they\u2019ll be asleep).\n*Imaging tests: Your care team will perform imaging tests like a computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Imaging determines the exact size and location of the affected area of your brain where the procedure will be done. The scanning usually takes about 30 minutes.\n*Procedure planning: Your care team (a neurosurgeon, a radiation oncologist, medical physicist and other team members) plan your treatment on a computer. They\u2019ll decide the area(s) to treat, the radiation dose and how to target the lesion for best results based on what they found on the imaging test. This can take up to an hour.\nThe steps of a Gamma Knife procedure include:\n*Fitting a frame on your head or using frameless options. A neurosurgeon will secure the frame or frameless option to your head and the Gamma Knife table.\n*Lying on a table. The table moves into the Gamma Knife machine that delivers radiation.\n*Receiving radiation. The machine may move your body and head slightly so the radiation can reach all treatment spots. You\u2019ll move out of the Gamma Knife machine when the procedure is done.\n*Removing the frame or frameless option from your head.\n*Removing the IV from your arm.\nYour care team will be immediately outside the room while you receive your treatment, but you\u2019ll never be alone during the procedure. Your team will monitor you constantly. There will be a microphone near your head so you can talk with your care team during your treatment if necessary.",

It allows you to store and break down the food you eat before it travels to your small intestine, which absorbs nutrients.\nBut if you develop a condition like stomach (gastric) cancer, your stomach can cause more harm than good. In that case, you may need a gastrectomy. Although a gastrectomy changes your digestive system, you can live (and eat) without a stomach.\nThere are two main types of gastrectomy:\n*Total gastrectomy removes your entire stomach.\n*Partial gastrectomy includes several surgery types that remove part of your stomach. The procedure names vary based on how much stomach tissue gets removed. For example, a subtotal gastrectomy removes about 80% of your stomach. Some types are classified based on their purpose. For example, gastric sleeve surgery is a partial gastrectomy that treats severe (Class III) obesity.",

                            "body": "Gastrectomy most commonly treats stomach cancer. You may need a total or partial gastrectomy to cure the cancer (eliminate it) or prevent it from spreading. Gastrectomy can also be palliative when the cancer isn\u2019t curable. This means the surgery relieves cancer symptoms, like stomach bleeding and pain.\nHealthcare providers sometimes use gastrectomy to treat other conditions. It may be a last resort when less invasive treatments like medicine and lifestyle changes haven\u2019t helped enough.\nGastrectomy treats:\n*Benign stomach tumors. Tumors that cause symptoms or may become cancerous may need to be removed.\n*Gastritis. In rare cases, inflammation in your stomach lining can cause severe symptoms that medication can\u2019t improve. You may need surgery.\n*Peptic ulcer disease. You may need surgery to treat stomach sores and ulcers that can damage your stomach lining.\n*Obesity. Your healthcare provider may recommend partial gastrectomy as a type of bariatric (weight loss) surgery if you have obesity that\u2019s harming your health.\n*Injuries. You may need parts of your stomach removed if an injury has damaged the tissue beyond repair.\nYou may choose to have your stomach removed to prevent hereditary diffuse stomach cancer. You\u2019re at high risk of developing this cancer if you inherit a mutation (error) in a gene called CDH1 from a biological parent. This cancer is nearly impossible to detect early when treatments work best. If you have this mutation, your healthcare provider may recommend total gastrectomy.",

They\u2019ll review your medical history and ask about all medicines, vitamins, herbs and supplements you\u2019re taking. They\u2019ll ask about allergies and your previous response to anesthesia.\n*Adjust your diet and exercise as needed. You may need to change your diet and exercise regimen to get in the best shape possible for surgery. Follow your provider\u2019s guidance to get healthier.\n*Stop using tobacco. You\u2019ll need to quit several weeks before surgery if you smoke or chew tobacco. Studies have shown that quitting smoking improves surgery outcomes in people with stomach cancer.\n*Adjust medications as needed. You may need to stop using certain medicines that can thin your blood, like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), aspirin and warfarin (Coumadin\u00ae). Your provider will review your medicines to ensure you know what to stop or continue taking to be safe for surgery.\n*Follow fasting instructions. You may need to stop eating or drinking before surgery. Follow your provider\u2019s instructions about what (and how much) is safe to consume.\n*Arrange for a ride from the hospital. You\u2019ll need someone to drive you home from the hospital.\n*Prepare your home. Relocate essential objects so they\u2019re easy to reach, and so you don\u2019t have to do any heavy lifting post-surgery. If possible, have someone stay with you to help during recovery. Ask your healthcare provider what type of live-in help you may need and for how long.",

                    "body": "During surgery, your surgeon removes all or parts of your stomach. They reconstruct your digestive system so you can continue to receive nourishment.\nYour healthcare provider will:\n*Administer anesthesia. You\u2019ll get medicine through an IV (a vein) that will put you to sleep for the operation. You won\u2019t feel any pain or be aware of what\u2019s happening.\n*Place necessary catheters. You may need a catheter to collect your urine (pee). The catheter goes inside your bladder and drains your urine. You may also need a nasogastric tube. This tube goes through your nose and into your stomach. It suctions out stomach contents. Afterward, a provider may use this tube to give medicine and nutrients.\n*Remove all or part of your stomach using open surgery or laparoscopy. With open surgery, your surgeon makes a single large cut that allows them to remove your stomach. Laparoscopy involves several small cuts. Your surgeon inserts a lighted instrument with a camera (laparoscope) into one cut so they can view your organs. They perform surgery through other cuts. If you have stomach cancer, they may also remove lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) to see if cancer has spread there.\n*Reconstruct your digestive system. Your surgeon will attach the remaining organs so your digestive system still works. For example, if they remove part of your stomach, they\u2019ll attach your small intestine to the remaining parts of your stomach. If they remove your entire stomach, they\u2019ll attach your small intestine to your esophagus. They may insert a feeding tube directly into your stomach or small intestine to help you eat during recovery.\n*Suture the cut. They\u2019ll stitch the cut or cuts.",

You may need to wear compression socks after surgery to reduce your risk of clotting.\nComplications unique to gastrectomy include:\n*Afferent and efferent loop (limb) syndrome. When digestive juices that need to flow freely to help you break down food get trapped in your small intestine. It can cause symptoms like abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting.\n*Anastomotic leak. When there\u2019s a leak at the new attachment sites.\n*Bile reflux. When bile, a substance your liver makes to digest fats, flows backward into your stomach or esophagus. The bile can break down the protective lining of your esophagus and stomach.\n*Dumping syndrome. When food travels to your small intestine before it\u2019s been broken down enough. This can cause unpleasant symptoms, including nausea, bloating, pain and diarrhea.\n*Malnutrition. When you\u2019re not getting enough of the right nutrients. Many people lose around 10% of their body weight in the first few months after surgery. Lack of nutrients can lead to other conditions, like anemia.\n*Internal hernia. When parts of your small intestine bulge through the membrane that attaches your intestine to your abdominal wall. A hernia can feel like pressure or pain in your abdomen. Internal hernias may require emergency treatment.\n*Narrowing at the attachment site. When the site that connects your partial stomach or esophagus and small intestine narrows. This can cause a bowel obstruction that makes it harder to poop.\n*Post-surgery gastroparesis. When your stomach doesn\u2019t process food as quickly as it should. This can cause symptoms like bloating, nausea and vomiting, and indigestion.\nTell your healthcare provider about any complications you\u2019re experiencing. It\u2019s important to attend all follow-up appointments so they can ensure you\u2019re healing without issues.",

                            "body": "You can live a healthy, normal life without a stomach. Still, you\u2019ll have to find a new normal regarding the types of food you eat and how often you eat. Foods you ate before without issues may make you feel sick after a gastrectomy. You\u2019ll likely need to find a new balance to ensure you get enough nutrients \u2014 without eating so much that you\u2019re straining your digestive system.\nHere are some tips to help you transition into your new normal post-surgery:\n*Get as much rest as you need. Take naps and go to bed early if you\u2019re feeling exhausted. Your body needs the rest.\n*Increase your meal frequency but decrease your portions. Instead of eating three large meals a day, eat six smaller meals. You may need to drink before or after meals instead of while you\u2019re eating.\n*Adjust what you eat. Some foods may be difficult to tolerate in the beginning. For example, foods high in fiber (like oats, rice, pasta and whole-grain bread) may be hard for your digestive system to process. Some people struggle with dairy after gastrectomy and become lactose intolerant. Take note of how different foods affect your digestive system. Learn what foods keep you feeling nourished and full.\n*Take vitamins and supplements as needed. Your body may be unable to absorb key nutrients after your gastrectomy. You may need to take vitamins or supplements to prevent malnourishment. For example, you may need to take vitamin B12, which can be especially challenging to digest without a stomach.\n*Don\u2019t overexert yourself (but keep moving). You\u2019ll need to take it easy as you heal, but you don\u2019t want to stop moving completely. Light exercise, like short walks, can prevent complications like blood clots. Although it may take some time, eventually, you may be able to return to regular exercise. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s guidance on what activities are safe.",

This organization promotes evidence-based care for transgender and gender-diverse people.\nMany insurance companies require you to submit documentation related to WPATH criteria before they cover surgery costs.\nCriteria include:\n*Providing informed consent. You\u2019ll need to demonstrate that you understand what\u2019s involved. This includes what happens during surgery and how it\u2019ll affect your life. These effects extend to your desire to have biological children. Many surgeries cause temporary or permanent infertility. Your provider will explain fertility preservation options, like freezing your eggs or sperm.\n*A history of gender incongruence. You may need to produce health records demonstrating a history of gender incongruence (usually a year or more).\n*A mental health evaluation. You may need a letter of support from a qualified mental health provider (therapist, psychiatrist or social worker). They\u2019ll work with you to determine the safest and healthiest options for embodying your gender. If you have gender dysphoria, they can help diagnose and treat related conditions, like anxiety and depression.\n*Hormone therapy. In some cases, you may need to be on hormone therapy before surgery. Depending on the procedure and desired outcomes, hormones can cause changes in your body that make surgery more effective.\nTo prepare for the procedure, your provider will review your medical history to ensure you\u2019re in good physical health. They may perform various tests, including:\n*A physical exam.\n*Blood tests.\n*Imaging tests.",

                    "body": "Gender reassignment is an outdated term for gender affirmation surgery. The new language, \u201cgender affirmation,\u201d is more accurate in terms of what the surgery does (and doesn\u2019t) do. No surgery can reassign your gender \u2014 who you know yourself to be. Instead, gender-affirming surgery changes your physical body so that it better aligns with how you understand (and wish to express) your gender.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nAll gender-affirming surgeries are major procedures. There are several steps involved and healthcare providers you\u2019ll likely meet with, including your primary care provider, a mental health specialist and a surgeon. Assembling the right care team makes all the difference when it comes to your surgery results and your care experience.\nResearch the providers you choose carefully. Pick a mental health professional with expertise in treating transgender and gender-diverse people. Find a surgeon with several years of experience performing the surgery you want. Ask about their track record of achieving positive results. This may be one of the most important procedures of your life. Choose a team that can deliver the best possible care."

Most people get general anesthesia, but sometimes, your provider may recommend local anesthesia or sedation.\nBoth types of genioplasty require an incision (cut). In genioplasty, your surgeon makes an incision inside your mouth. For a chin implant, your surgeon can make the incision inside your mouth or hide it under your chin.\nDuring chin implant surgery, your surgeon inserts the silicone implant. They\u2019ll will make sure the implant is centered and properly aligned.\nDuring a sliding genioplasty, your surgeon cuts part of your chin bone. They reposition the bone forward, backward or sideways to achieve the right chin shape. Your surgeon then secures the bone in place with plates and screws.\nWhen they\u2019re done, your surgeon closes the incision with dissolvable stitches. Sometimes, they put a bandage or wrap on your face to support your chin and reduce swelling. They may give you a dose of intravenous (through a vein in your arm) antibiotics to prevent infection.",

Glaucoma happens faster when the pressure inside your eye rises suddenly, and the damage is usually worse when glaucoma lasts longer or involves higher pressures.\nA goniotomy can lower eye pressure, helping prevent damage from happening or getting worse. But it can\u2019t reverse retina or optic nerve damage once they happen.",

                    "body": "At the start of a goniotomy procedure, your eye surgeon or anesthesiologist will give you medication to prevent any pain during the surgery. If you receive general anesthesia, it\u2019ll be through an intravenous (IV) line inserted into a vein somewhere on your body (usually your arm or hand).\nWhen everything is ready, your eye surgeon will make a small opening on the cornea of your eye. They\u2019ll use it to insert special tools into the anterior chamber (\u201canterior\u201d means \u201cfront\u201d), the liquid-filled space just behind your cornea.\nAfter the surgical tool is inside your eye, your surgeon will place a gonioscopic lens on the surface of your eye. These strong lenses need to touch your eyes to have maximum clarity. They let your surgeon see a magnified view inside your eye.\u00a0\nNow that your surgeon can see inside your eye, they\u2019ll maneuver them around carefully to where your iris and sclera meet. There\u2019s a band of tissue called the trabecular meshwork, and it goes all the way around your iris. Your eye surgeon will make cuts in that meshwork tissue, allowing more aqueous humor fluid to flow through it.\nWhen your surgeon finishes making those cuts (and if you aren\u2019t having any other eye procedures done at the same time), they\u2019ll withdraw the surgical tool(s) from your eye. They\u2019ll then give you a small, clear eye shield to wear. That shield keeps things from touching your eye, especially while you\u2019re asleep.",

You\u2019ll only need to take some of these medications, like antibiotics, for a few days, but others, like anti-inflammatory drugs, you\u2019ll need to take for weeks or even a month.\nRecovery from this surgery shouldn\u2019t be painful. Most people only need over-the-counter painkillers\u00a0like acetaminophen. Slight eye-watering, blurred vision, minor discomfort or soreness, or a feeling like you have sand or dust in your eye are normal and should stop within a few days.\nYour eye surgeon will also schedule regular follow-up visits. Your first follow-up visit will be the day after your surgery. Your eye surgeon will check the pressure inside your eye and make sure it\u2019s not too high or too low.

They\u2019ll evaluate whether you\u2019re a good candidate for the procedure. They\u2019ll perform a physical exam and learn more about your medical history. Your surgeon will recommend blood tests and imaging tests, like X-rays, as well.\nYour provider will also recommend a mental health evaluation. A hand transplant requires lifelong care and it can take a toll on your mental health. It helps to build a strong support system before the procedure so you have reliable assistance when you need it.\nBefore your procedure, you\u2019ll also need to follow specific instructions to reduce your risk of complications, like:\n*Stop smoking. Ask your provider for resources to help you quit.\n*Add, modify or adjust the dosage or types of medications or supplements you take, under your provider\u2019s guidance.\n*Participate in physical therapy or follow strengthening exercises that your provider recommends.\n*Manage any underlying health conditions.\n*Avoid using harmful substances like alcohol or unprescribed drugs.\nWhen your care team approves you as a candidate for a hand transplant, they\u2019ll place you on a waiting list. You\u2019re waiting for a deceased donor hand to become available that matches your criteria, like blood type, skin color, age, etc. The amount of time you\u2019ll wait varies and is usually unpredictable. Your care team may be able to give you a better timeline so you can make any arrangements that you need before the surgery. Once a donor is available, surgery follows quickly.",

Your providers may order multiple imaging tests, like X-rays, and bloodwork to monitor your recovery.\nYour care team will check on you often, making sure you\u2019re comfortable. You\u2019ll receive pain medications for any discomfort.\nYour providers will regularly check the function of your hand. This could include tapping on certain parts of your hand and arm and asking you to move your fingers. It could take some time before you\u2019re able to move your fingers, so don\u2019t feel discouraged if you can\u2019t do it immediately following surgery. A hand transplant will likely improve the function of your upper extremity but it\u2019s unlikely that your transplanted hand will function as fully as a non-transplanted hand.\nYour care team will also explain what medications you need to take and when you need to take them. The most important are anti-rejection medications (immunosuppressants). These prevent rejection. You\u2019ll need to take these medications as directed for the rest of your life. Talk to your provider about what you should do if you miss a dose and what side effects to look out for. Let them know if you experience any side effects or complications after surgery.\nYou\u2019ll meet with a certified hand therapist during your recovery. They\u2019ll help you exercise your hand to increase functionality.\u00a0\nSome hand transplant recipients meet with a mental health professional to help them manage any stress or challenges they might face after surgery.",

There are two types of hand transplant rejection:\n*Acute: Acute rejection happens a few days after the procedure. Your immune system quickly destroys tissues and blood vessels in your new hand. It can cause pain, swelling and skin discoloration. Medications can treat this type.\n*Chronic: Chronic rejection happens months to years after the procedure but can happen sooner. It occurs gradually. Immunosuppressants don\u2019t effectively stop your immune system from attacking your new hand. This could cause failure of the transplanted hand.\nApproximately 85% of hand transplant recipients develop acute rejection. Healthcare providers will test for rejection regularly and treat it with immunosuppressant therapy. You won\u2019t necessarily lose your new hand if acute rejection happens. It\u2019s treatable.

It treats mostly children and some adults who have seizures that don\u2019t respond to medicine. Following the surgery, you\u2019ll be in the hospital for five to seven days and then will go through a period of rehabilitation.",

                    "body": "A hemispherectomy is an operation that partially or completely removes or disconnects half of your child\u2019s brain from the rest of their brain. It\u2019s a rare procedure a surgeon performs in a hospital. Children (and occasionally adults) typically have this procedure for epilepsy that doesn\u2019t respond to medications. In people with this issue, the whole hemisphere is abnormal and responsible for causing seizures.\nThe \u201chemi\u201d part of \u201chemispherectomy\u201d means \u201chalf\u201d and refers to the cerebral (brain) hemisphere \u2014 half of your brain.

They can\u2019t use one hand as well as the other, and they might lose their peripheral (not central) vision.\n*Abnormal finding on a brain MRI that usually affects one side of their brain.\n*Developmental delay because of seizures.\nThese symptoms can be signs of the following conditions and diseases:\n*Malformations of cortical development: These disorders happen when something interferes with how the cerebral cortex develops.\n*Perinatal infarction (stroke): This is a stroke that happens during fetal brain development.\n*Hemimegalencephaly, also called unilateral (one-sided) megalencephaly: This disorder affects only one side of the brain and makes it larger than the other side.\n*Sturge-Weber syndrome: This condition causes blood vessels to grow too much, causing angiomas that can grow in the brain.\n*Rasmussen\u2019s encephalitis: This condition affects one-half of your brain and causes seizures because of inflammation.\nYour child might have started having seizures and weakness early in life. Their provider may suspect drug-resistant epilepsy and will refer you to a center that specializes in children with seizures.",

This happens in less than 5% of people who have a functional (disconnective) hemispherectomy.\nThe risk of hydrocephalus is a little bit higher if you have an anatomic hemispherectomy.

                    "question": "Why would someone have a hemorrhoidectomy?",
                    "body": "Your healthcare provider might recommend hemorrhoidectomy surgery if your hemorrhoids are more complicated than average. Complications that might require a hemorrhoidectomy include:\n*Prolapse. This means that your hemorrhoids have fallen down from inside your anus and now stick out of the opening, where they\u2019re more likely to irritate you, bleed or get injured. Prolapse is a gradual process that also tends to worsen over time. At first, hemorrhoids may only briefly emerge from your anus when you\u2019re having a bowel movement (Grade II hemorrhoids). But if you need to put them back in manually (Grade III), or if they won\u2019t go back in at all (Grade IV), your provider might recommend removing them.\n*Thrombosis. This is when your hemorrhoid has become so swollen that the blood inside it clots, cutting off its circulation. Thrombosed hemorrhoids have a purple-blue hue. They can be extremely painful. Sometimes they can rupture, causing severe bleeding. If you don\u2019t seek treatment right away, it\u2019ll eventually heal on its own. But in the painful first 72 hours, you might prefer surgery.\n*Strangulation. Grade IV hemorrhoids that have prolapsed and won\u2019t go back in are also called incarcerated hemorrhoids. An incarcerated hemorrhoid is at risk of strangulation. Strangulation means that it\u2019s trapped in a tight spot and its circulation has been pinched off. This is an emergency. Unlike thrombosis, strangulation won\u2019t resolve on its own. The strangulated tissues eventually die, causing gangrene.\n*Recurrence. Sometimes hemorrhoids don\u2019t go away or keep coming back after less invasive treatments. This can really impact your long-term quality of life. Where other treatments fail, hemorrhoidectomy has a 95% success rate. Even if you don\u2019t have any other complications, you might choose hemorrhoidectomy to take care of these hemorrhoids once and for all.",

The traditional way is to cut with a scalpel, seal the blood vessels and close the wound with dissolvable stitches.\nMore recently, surgeons have begun using an electrothermal device to both cut and seal the tissues and blood vessels. The electrothermal energy promotes healing of the tissues, leading to faster recovery.",

                    "body": "After hemorrhoidectomy surgery, you can expect some degree of:\n*Bleeding. Some bleeding after a hemorrhoidectomy is normal, especially after having a bowel movement (pooping). You might see blood in your stool or on your toilet paper. You might also see some in your underwear, along with some clear or yellow discharge. You can wear a sanitary pad or gauze to help soak up the fluid. This can last for up to a month. It shouldn\u2019t be a lot of blood. It\u2019s possible to split the wound open if you strain too hard to poop, which could cause more severe bleeding. It\u2019s important to avoid constipation to prevent this. Rarely, some people experience a postoperative hemorrhage, acute bleeding from the blood vessels that were cut in surgery. If you bleed a lot, call your provider.\n*Swelling. Swelling after a hemorrhoidectomy is normal. Swelling inside your anus can feel similar to hemorrhoids. You may feel like they\u2019re still there or think they\u2019ve come back, but this isn\u2019t the case. Sometimes a lump or a skin tag will develop at the site of the wound, which can also be deceiving. These generally go away once you\u2019ve healed. Healing time varies for everyone. You can help reduce the swelling by applying ice wrapped in a towel to the wound a few times a day for 10 minutes at a time. It also helps to lie on your stomach with a pillow supporting your hips. See if you can sleep this way.\n*Pain. You can expect some pain after a hemorrhoidectomy, and the pain levels people report are relatively high. But you should be able to manage your pain with medications. Healthcare providers usually offer a variety of strategies for managing pain, including oral and topical medications and gentle wound care. To get ahead of the pain after your operation, start your medications before you start to feel it. Most people say the pain is gone after two weeks. See your provider if your pain lasts longer than two weeks, if you\u2019re having trouble managing your pain or if your pain is preventing you from peeing or pooping.",

For others, it\u2019s a problem that can develop after surgery and with the use of pain medications.\nHealthcare providers suggest that you:\n*Gradually add fiber to your diet. Try eating high-fiber foods or take fiber supplements.\n*Avoid spicy foods. Spices can burn on the way out.\n*Drink plenty of water. Hydration is essential, especially as you add more fiber to your diet.\n*Try unfiltered apple juice or prune juice. These have natural laxative properties.\n*Use laxatives as needed. There are several types. Ask your provider what they advise.\n*Don\u2019t read on the toilet. Sitting on the commode too long is associated with constipation.\n*Use a step stool. Elevating your feet helps position your hips to make bowel movements easier.\n*Use gentle wipes. Baby wipes or medicated pads can help protect your tender tissues.\n*Use topical anesthetic.

But if you\u2019re ready to be done with your hemorrhoids once and for all, it\u2019s worth considering.\nThe hemorrhoidectomy experience has been gradually improving as surgeons adopt new tricks and techniques to make your recovery more comfortable. Its reputation isn\u2019t necessarily up to date.\nNevertheless, it\u2019s likely to be a little rough some of the time.

There may be a slightly higher risk of a hernia returning with laparoscopic surgery. Still, laparoscopic and robotic surgery cause less scarring and usually involve fewer pain medicines, and they have a quicker recovery than open surgery.\nYour healthcare provider will explain the benefits, including likely surgery outcomes, based on your hernia and overall health."

Your care team will work to minimize and prevent these as much as possible.\nShort-term complications or side effects following hernia surgery include:\n*Infection at the incision site.\n*Seromas (collection of fluid).\n*Hematomas (collection of blood).\n*Injury to nearby tissue, organs or blood vessels.\n*Problems emptying your bladder (you may need a catheter in the short term to help).\nComplications that occur after recovery often require a return visit to your provider to address. These include:\n*Erosion or breakdown of the surgical mesh.\n*Infection deep inside the tissue where the surgical mesh is.\n*Hernia recurrence (although this is rare).\nPain during sex. In men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB), hernia repair in the groin area can damage the nerve vessels or disrupt blood flow, causing pain in your testicles or infertility. Still, the rate of testicular complications is low (.3% to 7.2%).\nSome people experience long-term pain after surgery. Pain that lasts longer than three months is called post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia. If you\u2019re diagnosed with this condition, you may need medications or surgery.",

It\u2019s also called a tourist handle or \u201cJ\u201d handle. It\u2019s not the most ergonomic style, but it works for occasional use.\n*Derby handle: The derby handle is a common traditional style. It\u2019s a perpendicular handle with a slight downward curve at the end, like a bird beak. It\u2019s comfortable and good for hanging.\n*Fritz handle. Also called a crutch handle, the Fritz is like a slimmer, more tapered derby handle without the hook at the end. This makes it easier to grip if you have arthritis in your hand.\n*Offset handle: An offset handle positions your hand over the shaft rather than to the side of it. The shaft of the cane has a bend near the top. This allows you to put more weight on the cane.\n*Orthopedic grip handle: These ergonomic handles have contours that fit your hand and reduce stress on your fingers, palms and wrists. They often have a flexible grip made of foam or gel.\n*Palm grip handle: A palm grip handle is molded to fit your hand \u2014 your right or left hand, specifically.

If you\u2019re using an older cane, the tip might need replacing. Tips are easy to find at most pharmacies.\n*Make sure your path is clear of potential hazards for your cane, like loose rugs, cords and spills. Avoid wet and waxed floors. If you want to walk in winter weather, you can use a special tip.\n*Don\u2019t use your cane to help yourself sit down or stand up. The weight balance isn\u2019t reliable this way. Use your opposite hand on the arm of your seat to push yourself up or lower yourself down.\n*Wear proper walking shoes with low, closed heels and non-slippery soles. If they have laces, tie them in a double knot. This is to prevent you from tripping or needing to look down at your feet.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nUsing a cane can help you walk more safely and comfortably \u2014 but only if you have the right fit and technique. A poor fit or poor technique can cause new stress and strain and raise your risk of falling.\nWhile everyone has seen a cane, not all of us have had the chance to practice using one. Don\u2019t look to actors to show you how to use a cane correctly. Instead, consult a knowledgeable healthcare provider."

It has three or four larger wheels with brakes for traversing uneven terrain. They often have storage and a seat for rest breaks.\n*Forearm support walker: Also called a platform walker, upright walker or gutter frame, this walker allows you to bear weight on your forearms instead of your wrists. A padded \u201cgutter\u201d supports your forearms, positioned at 90 degrees. The walker may have two or four wheels.\n*Reverse walker: A reverse or posterior walker is a four-wheeled frame that you pull behind you rather than pushing in front of you. You hold the frame at the sides of your hips rather than in front. This option provides more posture support and stability if you tend to tip backward.\n*Knee walker: A knee walker is a specialized walker that you use when you can\u2019t walk on one foot. It\u2019s usually a short-term solution. The walker has four wheels and a platform that you rest your knee on. You push yourself along with the other foot while holding onto the handlebars."

Talk to your healthcare provider about ways to reduce your discomfort. Performing certain exercises and applying a warm compress may help.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nGetting a hysterectomy can be an emotional experience. While it can offer relief and peace of mind, it can also be a difficult recovery and leave you with feelings of loss. If your healthcare provider recommends a hysterectomy, make sure you understand the procedure and how to safely recover from surgery. Be sure to follow their recommendations on things to avoid while you recover at home. Most people can go back to their usual activities six to eight weeks after a hysterectomy."

Surgeons do this procedure when your large intestine can\u2019t be used to store and move waste.\nThe ileum is the last portion of your small intestine. During an ileostomy, a surgeon creates a hole in your abdominal wall and brings up the small intestine through this hole. Then, they\u2019ll open part of your intestine (usually the part called the ileum) and sew it to your skin. As a result, poop exits your body through the new hole and collects in an ostomy bag that sticks to your skin. The opening created during your ostomy procedure is a stoma.\nDepending on why you need it, an ileostomy can be temporary or permanent. If you have a temporary ileostomy, your surgeon can do an ostomy reversal after some time depending on why you needed the ileostomy in the first place.",

It can be difficult adjusting to new routines, and the differences you now face can feel isolating. Be patient with yourself. Talk to a counselor or therapist about how you\u2019re feeling. Consider joining a support group. Your healthcare provider is also here to help. Ask them about resources that can help you adjust to life with an ostomy."

You might have an ostomy if you\u2019re recovering from an injury or disease in your bowel that prevented you from using it normally. After your bowel has recovered, you might be a candidate for ostomy reversal surgery.\nA surgeon creates a colostomy or ileostomy by splitting your bowel and redirecting the end of your large intestine (colon) or small intestine (ileum) to an opening in your abdomen (a stoma). Ostomy reversal surgery connects your bowels and closes your stoma, allowing you to poop out of your anus (butthole) once again.",

Ostomy reversal may not be an option for everyone.\nIf your surgeon expects your ostomy to be permanent, they might complete it in a more permanent way (end ostomy). But if they expect it might be temporary, they can complete it in a less permanent way (loop ostomy).

                    "body": "Common short-term side effects include:\n*Some discomfort. Most people are sore after surgery, but most can manage with household pain relievers. Your abdomen might feel bloated or swollen at first, and you might feel tired.\n*Paralytic ileus. It\u2019s typical for your bowels to be temporarily paralyzed after abdominal surgery. Your healthcare team will expect this and treat you accordingly. It should resolve in a few days.\n*Poop changes. Your bowels may take some time to regain their normal functioning. Some of the nerves and muscles involved will be out of practice, and swelling from surgery can also have an effect. Diarrhea is common, but constipation can also occur. You might also feel you have to go more frequently or urgently than before. This may last from a few days up to a few months.\nPossible long-term side effects include:\n*Hernias. Since repeat abdominal surgeries weaken your abdominal wall, it\u2019s possible you could develop a hernia at the incision site. That\u2019s when an organ or tissue pokes through the weak spot. Some hernias never need treatment, but some may eventually need surgical repair.\n*Abdominal adhesions. Abdominal surgery can sometimes cause bands of scar tissue, called adhesions, to develop in your abdomen that make your tissues stick together. They don\u2019t always cause trouble, but occasionally they might obstruct your bowels and need to be removed.\n*Fecal incontinence. Some people may continue to have difficulties with bowel control after ostomy reversal if their anorectal muscles and nerves remain weak or uncoordinated. In this case, healthcare providers recommend physical therapy to help retrain the muscles.",

        "Introduction": "Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is a type of external beam radiation therapy. Radiation oncologists often use IGRT to treat tumors in areas of your body that move, like tumors in your lungs or prostate. Using image-guided radiation therapy lets providers track tumor movement during treatment so they can redirect radiation treatment as needed.",

                    "question": "What is image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)?",
                    "body": "Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) is a type of radiation therapy. This treatment kills cancerous cells and shrinks or eliminates cancerous tumors. You may need IGRT if you have cancer in an area of your body that moves during treatment. For example, a tumor in your lung may move when you take a breath. To make sure providers target treatment areas accurately, your radiation team needs to do specific daily targeting. IGRT makes it possible for your radiation team to do that.\nIGRT is a type of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). It uses a machine called a linear accelerator (LINAC). The machine directs targeted radiation in the form of high-energy X-ray/photon beams into cancerous cells and tumors to destroy them. The machine never touches your body.\nLike other types of EBRT, image-guided radiation therapy uses the results of imaging tests to target cancerous cell areas or tumor masses. With IGRT, radiation oncologists take images before and during your treatment sessions. That way, they can immediately redirect radiation \u2014 if needed \u2014 so energy beams stay optimally focused on cancerous tumors and avoid nearby healthy tissue.",

It occurs when there\u2019s damage to the endplates of your vertebrae (the bones in your spine). Your endplates are protective barriers located between your vertebrae (made of hard bone) and your spinal disks (made of cushiony, gel-filled cartilage). They also carry blood and nutrients to your disks. Damaged end plates can trigger pain at the basivertebral nerve inside your vertebrae.\nYour basivertebral nerves run through the bone of each vertebra and branch off to supply each endplate. That\u2019s why vertebrogenic pain is so specific.\nThe Intracept procedure uses radiofrequency energy to heat a narrow point on your basivertebral nerve. That disrupts pain signals that travel from your spine to your brain, offering relief from vertebrogenic pain.\nHealthcare providers often recommend the Intracept procedure when nonsurgical options like medications, injections or physical therapy aren\u2019t effective enough. It\u2019s a less-invasive alternative to open spinal surgery.",

They insert a flexible tube through an incision (surgical cut) in your skin and inject contrast dye through it, into your bile ducts. Your provider then uses an X-ray machine to send images of your bile duct to a monitor. Contrast dye is a liquid that either blocks or absorbs more X-rays than the tissue around it, which makes structures in your body defined and more easily seen on medical imaging (it\u2019s not the kind of dye that stains your skin).",

The implant gives you a sharper, more defined jaw angle. It also brings the lower part of your face into balance (symmetry) with the upper part of your face.\nHealthcare providers sometimes call jaw implants jaw augmentation (enlargement), jaw enhancement or a mandibular implant. Mandible is the medical term for your lower jawbone.",

The healthy organs can perform all the functions that the failing kidney and pancreas can\u2019t.\nYou\u2019re asleep for the entire surgery under general anesthesia. Your surgeon makes an incision in your abdomen. The kidney transplant typically happens first. Your surgeon places the donor kidney in the lower right or left side of your abdomen and connects it to nearby veins and arteries. The vein and artery of the new kidney are then attached to your vein and artery. Finally, the ureter from the new kidney will be connected to your urinary bladder to allow pee to pass out of your body. Often, your original kidneys are left in place (not removed).\nYour surgeon then places your new pancreas on the lower right side of your abdomen and connects it to nearby blood vessels. Placing the pancreas in this position allows it to be easily connected to veins, arteries and your small bowel. The vein and artery of the new pancreas are attached to your vein and artery. There will be a small segment of small bowel attached to the pancreas to allow pancreatic juice (for digestion) to go back to your digestive system. Most of the time, your surgeon will not remove your old pancreas.\nThe new organs should start functioning within a few hours, which means your new pancreas creates insulin to regulate your blood sugar.\nMost people spend between eight and 12 days in the hospital after a transplant, but some people may stay for up to 28 days (one month).",

As your body recognizes the new organs as foreign objects, it will normally try to get rid of them or \u201creject\u201d them. But immunosuppressant medications (anti-rejection medication) should prevent rejection. You\u2019ll need to take these medications for life. Immunosuppressant medications weaken your immune system, which makes you more susceptible to more serious complications of infections or illnesses.\nAdditionally, your provider will want to have your blood drawn periodically to prevent rejection.\nLet your provider know if you experience any of the following symptoms:\n*Fever.\n*Drainage of pus or fluid from the transplant site.\n*Tenderness or soreness at the transplant site.\n*Pain when peeing.\nOther possible risks include blood clots and excessive bleeding (hemorrhage).

In most cases, they\u2019ll instruct you to lie on your stomach on a surgical table so they can perform the procedure through your back. But if you have a transplanted kidney, you\u2019ll lie on your back because they perform the procedure through your belly (lower abdomen). The provider will numb the area and give you moderate sedation or general anesthesia so you won\u2019t feel pain.\nThe radiologist or nephrologist will take the sample through one of these approaches:\n*Percutaneous biopsy. This is the most common type of kidney biopsy. They\u2019ll numb your skin and insert a needle to take the kidney tissue sample. The provider may use ultrasound or CT imaging (computed tomography imaging) to guide the needle to the best location in your kidney. A percutaneous biopsy typically involves moderate sedation. But providers perform some percutaneous biopsies without sedation if you\u2019re at risk or you don\u2019t want it.\n*Open biopsy. In an open biopsy, the provider will use a surgical knife (scalpel) to make a small cut (incision) in your skin, remove tissue from your kidney and close the incision with stitches.

                    "body": "Kidney donations may come from a recently deceased or living donor. There are two kinds of living kidney donations:\n*Living related. A living related kidney donation comes from a biological (blood-related) relative, such as a parent or sibling.\n*Living unrelated. A living unrelated kidney donation comes from a friend or another person who doesn\u2019t share a blood relation with the recipient.\nOther types of kidney donation include:\n*Directed kidney donation. In a directed kidney donation, you choose (direct) who receives your kidney.\n*Paired kidney exchange. A paired kidney exchange requires two living donors and two recipients. All organ transplants work best when the donor and recipient have the same blood and tissue types. But if the donor and recipient don\u2019t share the same blood and tissue types (aren\u2019t compatible), the donor can give their kidney to someone else who is a match. In return, a family member or friend of the recipient donates a kidney to a family member or friend of the donor. A paired kidney exchange helps noncompatible donors find and pair with compatible donors using a nationwide kidney registry database (National Kidney Registry).\n*Nondirected or altruistic kidney donation. In a nondirected or altruistic kidney donation, the donor doesn\u2019t know the recipient. They unselfishly donate a kidney because they know it\u2019ll help another person."

                    "question": "Who can be a living kidney donor?",
                    "body": "You must meet several conditions to be a living kidney donor, including:\n*Age. You must be at least 18 years old to donate a kidney. People under 18 aren\u2019t adults and can\u2019t give informed consent to donate a kidney. There isn\u2019t an age limit for donating a kidney. People in their 90s have successfully donated a kidney.\n*Physical examination. A healthcare provider will evaluate your physical health to ensure you\u2019re capable of donating a kidney. A physical exam may include checking your overall health, medical history, biological family health history (including whether you have any biological family history of kidney disease), which prescription and nonprescription medications you\u2019re taking, an assessment of your kidneys and other organ systems and various tests. Pregnant people can\u2019t donate a kidney. You should have a body mass index (BMI) less than 35 and you shouldn\u2019t smoke, vape or use other forms of tobacco. The goal of this health evaluation is to ensure you\u2019re fit to donate.\n*Psychological evaluation. A group of healthcare providers will evaluate you to ensure you\u2019re physically and mentally able to donate a kidney. They\u2019ll discuss potential causes of stress that may arise for you and your support system after a kidney donation, including recovery setbacks. Your evaluation usually includes psychiatrists and social workers. It may also include living donor advocates and bioethics professionals. A living donor advocate helps you understand what the procedure and recovery entails and ensures no one\u2019s pressuring you to consent to the donation. A bioethics professional makes sure your personal beliefs and freedoms with regard to your health are respected.\nIn the United States, you can register to be a kidney donor through Donate Life America. In many states, you can also register through your local motor vehicle department.",

                    "question": "What happens during kidney donation surgery?",
                    "body": "A kidney donation care team typically consists of:\n*A urologist or a transplant surgeon.\n*An anesthesiologist.\nThe anesthesiologist will sedate you with general anesthesia. You\u2019ll be asleep, won\u2019t move and won\u2019t feel any pain during the procedure. The anesthesiologist will usually review your health records before surgery to ensure you won\u2019t have any problems with anesthesia. After you\u2019re asleep, a provider will insert a Foley catheter to drain any pee from your urinary bladder. The catheter will remain in place during surgery and for 24 hours after surgery to monitor your urine output.\nA radical nephrectomy is the name of the procedure to remove your entire kidney. The urologist typically removes a kidney. They usually use a minimally invasive laparoscopic approach. A laparoscope is a thin, metal surgical tool with a light and camera at the end. During a laparoscopic radical nephrectomy, the surgeon will:\n*Use a sharp surgical knife (scalpel) to make three to five small cuts (incisions) in your side. The incisions are usually less than an inch (2.5 cm) each.\n*Insert a laparoscope into an incision. The laparoscope shows video on a monitor near the operating table.\n*Using the monitor as a guide, insert tiny instruments through an incision and remove the kidney.\n*Close the incisions with dissolvable stitches or staples.\nIn some cases, the urologist may need to use an open approach to perform a radical nephrectomy. During an open radical nephrectomy, the surgeon will make one single incision of about 8 to 12 inches (20 to 30 cm) in your side. With a larger incision, the surgeon has a better view and more access to the surrounding access. Less than 5% of all nephrectomies use an open approach.\nAfter removing your kidney, your care team will transport it to the kidney recipient. The kidney recipient is usually in a nearby operating room in the same hospital. Another surgical team will operate on the recipient and complete the transplant.",

You\u2019ll wake up after a few minutes, but you\u2019ll likely feel groggy.\n*Move you to a recovery room and monitor your overall health and recovery from surgery.\n*Manage your pain and ensure you\u2019re getting IV fluids until you\u2019re fully awake and can drink safely. They\u2019ll slowly introduce you to food as you can tolerate it. They\u2019ll also ask you to walk as early as possible. Walking helps your body recover faster after surgery.\nMost people stay in the hospital for two to three days. You may feel pain, tenderness or itching in your incision site(s) for a few days. It\u2019s also common to feel fatigue the first few weeks after a kidney donation.\nOnce the care team determines that you no longer require monitoring, they\u2019ll let you go home (discharge you). You\u2019ll need a family member or friend to drive you home. It\u2019s a good idea to have someone help take care of you for at least a week after donating a kidney.\nSchedule an appointment with the transplant surgeon and a doctor who specializes in treating kidney conditions (nephrologist) in the first week after discharge. You must schedule appointments with your transplant team for the first two years after your donation. Your appointments occur at six-month, 12-month and 24-month intervals. You must also schedule follow-up appointments with your primary care physician (PCP).",

                    "body": "Many living kidney donors find it rewarding to donate a kidney to a loved one. It can be challenging to see a family member deal with kidney failure symptoms and dialysis. By donating a kidney, you can see your loved one\u2019s symptoms improve firsthand as they return to the everyday activities they used to enjoy before their kidneys stopped working. They also no longer need dialysis.\nSome people who receive a kidney from a deceased donor have mixed feelings because they know that someone had to die for a kidney to become available. It\u2019s helpful to remember that many donor families feel a sense of comfort and peace knowing that their loved one\u2019s death can help others.\nThere are also benefits to kidney recipients. The main benefit of a kidney donation for a recipient is that it helps treat kidney failure. A successfully transplanted kidney filters waste products and excess fluids from your blood. You also won\u2019t need to continue dialysis.\nThose who receive a kidney from a living donor reap other benefits, including:\n*Longer organ life. Living donor kidneys can last 15 to 20 years. Kidneys from a deceased donor function for about 10 to 15 years.\n*Faster kidney function. A kidney from a living donor starts working quickly after a transplant because it\u2019s out of the donor\u2019s body for only a short period. If you receive a kidney from a deceased donor, you may need dialysis until the transplanted kidney starts to work.\n*Less risk of rejection. A kidney from a biological family member is often a better genetic match than a kidney from a stranger. There\u2019s less risk of your body\u2019s immune system rejecting the kidney.\nLiving donation surgery is also an elective surgery. That means the surgical date is set, and the kidney recipient is well-prepared for surgery.",

Cortisone shots can cause these levels to spike. Cortisone shots also have more serious potential side effects than gel shots. Although rare, the risks increase with repeated use.\nCortisone shots usually work faster and more consistently than gel shots to relieve knee pain. Gel shots don\u2019t work for everyone, and when they do, they can take a few weeks to kick in. Cortisone shots kick in more immediately, but they only last a few months.

You should avoid bending or twisting motions right after surgery. Gradually do more each day, as your body allows and as your healthcare provider recommends.\nBe sure to follow the instructions your provider gives you. Physical therapy (exercises and stretches that strengthen your muscles) may help you move more easily, with less pain.\nMost people feel well enough to drive within a week to two weeks after surgery. You can go back to work (non-strenuous activities) within one month if you didn\u2019t have spinal fusion with a laminectomy."

Move skin tissue, muscles and ligaments away from your spine.\n*Cut the lamina bone to open it. They\u2019ll create a hinge or gap on one side of the lamina rather than completely removing the bone.\n*Place a bone graft or metal plates and screws to secure the new opening. This doesn\u2019t fuse bones together. Each vertebral level gets its own plate to maintain your current mobility.\n*Move your muscles, ligaments and skin back into place. Close the incision.\nYour surgeon may perform a foraminotomy after a laminoplasty. A foraminotomy decompresses nerve roots to relieve pain. In addition, your surgeon might place a drain at your incision site to regulate bleeding. They\u2019ll remove it after 24 hours or when your care team finds it appropriate, depending on your situation.",

                    "body": "A laminotomy is surgery to remove a piece of your lamina. The lamina is the back part of a vertebra (bone) in your spine. The lamina protects and supports the back of your spinal cord.\nUnlike a laminectomy, which removes the entire lamina, a surgeon will drill a hole into the lamina and only remove a small piece of it for a laminotomy. This relieves pressure on compressed nerves.\nMany people choose a laminotomy if they experience nerve pain that doesn\u2019t go away with other forms of treatment. It\u2019s minimally invasive.",

Surgeons may make up to three more cuts to insert other surgical instruments so they can see all the organs in your belly and find any problems.\nThe laparoscope camera projects an image of the inside of your belly or pelvis onto a monitor in real time. Using these images, surgeons can watch their hand motions during the procedure.\nYour healthcare provider might recommend a laparoscopy if other diagnostic tests can\u2019t identify the cause of your condition.

        "Introduction": "A lateral internal sphincterotomy is a surgical incision into one of your anal sphincter muscles. It\u2019s a treatment for anal fissures that have failed to heal. Cutting the muscle helps release excess tension that may be preventing the wound from healing. The surgery has a high success rate and a low rate of complications.",

                    "body": "A lateral internal sphincterotomy is a surgical operation on your internal anal sphincter, the ring of smooth muscle that surrounds your anal canal. A sphincterotomy is a type of myotomy, which means your surgeon makes a small cut into the muscle to relieve excess tension. They do this when excess tension in the muscle is causing complications.",

                    "body": "Most people have a lateral internal sphincterotomy to treat a chronic anal fissure. An anal fissure is a painful tear in the lining of your anal canal. It becomes chronic when it fails to heal after at least eight weeks. Most anal fissures heal easily. When they don\u2019t, it\u2019s because excess tension in the internal sphincter muscle is preventing them from healing.",

                    "body": "When an anal fissure exposes the muscle underneath the anal lining, it can trigger uncontrollable spasms. Spasms pull the wound apart and reduce blood flow, preventing it from healing. Pain, especially with pooping, increases the tension and spasms. Eventually, the muscle begins to bulk up from the exercise, which widens the fissure."

Healthcare providers recommend surgery when it appears your fissure won\u2019t heal without it. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is the most common surgery they recommend. It has a high success rate and low rate of complications."

(Lateral means coming from the side.)\nYou have two anal sphincter muscles that surround your anal canal and help control your bowel movements. The internal sphincter is the inner ring, while the external sphincter surrounds it. The external one is under your control, but the internal one is involuntary. This one stays contracted as a default, and only relaxes during bowel movements.\nYour surgeon will cut into the muscle directly under your anal fissure to release tension. The aim is to reduce the constant pressure by 20% to 50%. This should prevent spasms and improve blood flow, enabling your fissure to heal. They\u2019ll locate the anal fissure using an anoscope (speculum), then use a scalpel or electrocautery to cut the muscle beneath.\nThe procedure itself takes about 30 minutes. The whole appointment might be two to three hours.",

Instead, a surgeon cuts out the surface layer of the wound, which may have developed scar tissue from chronic healing and reopening. They also remove other skin complications, like skin tags or piles, to help the wound heal.\nSurgeons usually combine a fissurectomy with a Botox\u00ae injection into the sphincter muscle to help it relax. The injection lasts for a few months, long enough to allow the fissure to heal. Some surgeons feel this is a safer alternative for people who may be more prone to incontinence. Since Botox is temporary, it shouldn\u2019t have long-term effects on your muscle.",

Long-term incontinence after LIS is rare and usually minimal. But some people may be more at risk of long-term incontinence than others. In these cases, some surgeons might recommend fissurectomy instead.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nIf you have an anal fissure that hasn\u2019t healed for eight weeks or more, you\u2019ve already been through a lot. It can be daunting to consider having surgery on top of it all. But surgery will bring the relief you need. Even right after your sphincterotomy, your pain levels are likely to be better than before. And after a few days of healing, you\u2019ll start to feel much better."

A successfully salvaged limb is free of disease, works as it should and has an acceptable cosmetic result.\nWhether this is possible for your limb will depend on the specifics of your condition, including:\n*Extent of disease. If a tumor is too big or has grown into the surrounding structures, it may not be possible to remove it without damaging important functional parts. Similarly, if an infection has spread too far or caused too much damage, it may not be possible to save your limb.\n*Extent of injuries. Surgeons use scoring systems to rate the severity of injuries that have damaged your nerves, tissues, blood vessels or bones. They\u2019ll need to replace what they can\u2019t repair. If too many parts are beyond repair, they can\u2019t replace them all individually. They\u2019ll also need to be sure they can restore blood flow to all of your tissues. Without it, tissues will die.",

If you have cancer, your healthcare team might want to treat it with chemotherapy or radiation therapy prior to surgery. This can potentially shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove.\n*Pre-operative assessment. Your healthcare team may need to use various tests to assess your condition, including imaging tests to examine your limb, like an MRI or CT scan, and tests that examine your blood flow, like a CT angiogram or Doppler ultrasound. They\u2019ll also consider your overall health, including preexisting conditions that might affect the success of the surgery.\n*Pre-operative discussion. Whenever possible, your team will discuss the surgery with you before proceeding. They\u2019ll explain what they plan to do, the risks and challenges ahead and the potential outcomes, and ask for your informed consent.

If you\u2019ve lost blood flow to part of your limb, your surgeon will need to restore it. Surgeons use vascular surgery techniques to repair vessels and restore blood flow.\n*Microsurgery. Your surgeon might need to replace a piece of vascular tissue or nerve tissue with a piece from a donor or your own body (a \u201cflap\u201d) and then connect the blood vessels or nerves.\n*Grafting. Your surgeon might need to take a piece of bone (bone graft) or skin (skin graft) from a donor or your own body and use it to replace a damaged or missing part of your limb.\n*Prosthesis. Your surgeon might use metal implants to replace or repair a bone or a joint to restore the functionality of your limb. Some prosthetics combine metal with a bone graft.\n*Bone transport. To fill in or lengthen long bones, your surgeon may apply a stainless-steel fixator system (like the Taylor Spatial Frame or Ilizarov apparatus) that stimulates bone growth.",

This is ideal for people with downturned or drooping lips. Plastic surgeons sometimes combine a corner lip lift with another lip lift procedure.\u00a0\n*Gullwing lip lift (direct lip lift): Your surgeon makes an incision along the border of the upper lip in the shape of a flying seagull. This creates a more defined top lip.\u00a0\n*Italian lip lift: This lift is more subtle than the bullhorn lift and involves two incisions at each nostril. However, it doesn\u2019t lift the center of the lip. \n*V to Y lip lift (V-Y advancement): Your surgeon will make an incision in the shape of a letter V and close the incision in the shape of the letter Y.",

Talk to a healthcare provider about what types of treatment they recommend for your situation.\u00a0\nIf you had lip filler with hyaluronic acid and are unhappy with how it looks, you could wait until the substance naturally dissolves.

But if you don\u2019t like the shape of your lips or feel that your lips are too big, you probably think about them a lot. If this is the case, there are options.\nLip reduction surgery reshapes and reduces the size of your lips. This can be a very personal decision to get a look that\u2019s right for you. But it\u2019s safe, and the results are permanent. Talk to your healthcare provider about whether you\u2019re a good candidate for lip reduction surgery or another cosmetic procedure. Always make sure you\u2019re making the decision to change the look of your body for your own reasons and not because someone else is influencing your decision."

You\u2019ll have blood tests in advance to measure your total number of blood cells and platelets and to check how well your blood clots to stop a bleed. If your platelet count is low, you might receive a transfusion before your biopsy to boost your blood clotting ability.\n*Sometimes fasting. Your healthcare provider might ask you to avoid eating and drinking for up to eight hours before the procedure. These requirements might depend on the type of liver biopsy you\u2019re having and other factors. Follow your healthcare provider\u2019s instructions.\n*Planning ahead. If you\u2019re having sedation for the procedure, you\u2019ll need to plan for someone else to drive you home. Let them know you\u2019ll be at the hospital for up to four hours before you\u2019re discharged. You should also plan to take it easy during the following week.",

The healthcare provider performing your liver biopsy might want to locate the spot where they\u2019ll insert the needle in advance, using radiology imaging. They might do this with an ultrasound or a CT scan (computed tomography scan). Some providers find the spot just by tapping on your abdomen.\n*Sedation. If you\u2019re having a percutaneous or transvenous liver biopsy, you may choose to have a little medication to help you relax. If you do, a healthcare provider will install an IV line into one of your veins to deliver medication and fluids. (For surgery, you\u2019ll have general anesthesia.)\nDuring the biopsy procedure:\n*You\u2019ll lie on your back and a healthcare provider will clean and sterilize the site on your skin where the needle will go in. For a percutaneous liver biopsy, this is over your liver, under your right ribcage. For a transvenous liver biopsy, it\u2019s over your jugular vein in the side of your neck.\n*A healthcare provider will inject a local anesthetic (such as lidocaine) into the site to numb the area. This may sting for a minute before the numbing sets in. Once you\u2019re numb, your healthcare provider will make a small incision in the skin to make way for the biopsy needle.\n*The biopsy needle is hollow and about the diameter of a paper clip. There are two general types: a suction needle and a cutting needle. The suction type (core aspiration needle) draws in the tissue sample with a syringe. The cutting type has a spring-loaded cutting mechanism inside it.\n*Your provider will locate the correct spot on your liver and select the type of needle they want. Different types are better for different purposes. They\u2019ll ask you to lie very still and may ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds as they direct the needle to the right spot in your liver.\n*If you\u2019re having a percutaneous liver biopsy, this part is quick. They\u2019ll consult their radiology images, and the needle will go in and out in a matter of seconds. You might feel some pressure when the needle goes in. When it comes out, they\u2019ll apply pressure and bandage the site.\n*For a transvenous liver biopsy, your provider will use fluoroscopy, a type of X-ray imaging, to see where your vein connects to your liver. They\u2019ll inject a contrast dye into the vein to make it show up. Then they\u2019ll insert a thin catheter into the vein and thread it down to your liver. They\u2019ll thread the biopsy needle through the catheter to reach your liver and take the sample.\n*After bandaging your incision, they\u2019ll position you on your right side. You\u2019ll stay in this position for a few minutes. Lying on your right side applies pressure to your liver. This is meant to help stop it from bleeding, in the same way that you apply pressure to a bleeding flesh wound.",

                    "body": "A lumbar drain is a small, flexible tube that removes cerebrospinal fluid from the spinal column in your lower back.\nYour brain and spinal cord (the bundle of nerves that runs up and down the vertebrae) are surrounded by a fluid made up of water with some salt and important proteins. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nIn some cases, healthcare providers learn about certain diseases by studying this fluid, much like they can learn about certain other diseases by taking a sample of blood. In the case of CSF, not only can there be abnormal things in the fluid, but sometimes, the pressure can also be abnormally high or low.\nA healthcare provider will place a lumbar drain in your lumbar spine. This is in your lower back, usually about two to three inches above your butt. As the fluid circulates around your brain and spine, taking it out from your lower back will provide the same information as taking it from your neck or head, and it\u2019s safer.\nWhile the tube is in, your provider will use a lumbar drain to:\n*Externally remove excess CSF.\n*Measure the amount of CSF in your body.\n*Look for abnormal cells or proteins in the CSF or other signs of things not working right.\n*Monitor intracranial pressure (pressure inside of your skull).\nA lumbar drain is usually only temporary. It\u2019ll stay in your body for a few days before removal.",

This can be difficult to do if you\u2019re an active person, but your care team will offer solutions to help you stay as comfortable as possible.\nIt\u2019s best, while you have the lumbar drain in, to contact a caregiver before sitting up or getting out of bed unless you have been specifically told otherwise. A caregiver can turn the drain on and off to control the amount of fluid that comes out. For example, if the drain is open and you stand up, it can cause too much fluid to come out.\nWhen your CSF levels are stable, your provider will remove the lumbar drain catheter completely from your body.

The goal is to eliminate all cancer cells by removing the tumor instead of removing your breast entirely, as with a mastectomy.\nFor this reason, a lumpectomy is often called breast-conserving surgery.\nMost people who get a lumpectomy to treat cancer also get radiation therapy afterward.

The thinking goes: For less serious breast cancers, you can remove the tumor but keep your breast.\nBut it\u2019s not that straightforward. Research has shown that in many cases (not just early-stage cancer), a lumpectomy with radiation has the same survival outcomes as a mastectomy. It has the same recurrence rate. Increasingly, lumpectomy with radiation has become the recommended first treatment for various types of breast cancer.\nThe procedure that provides the best benefit depends on numerous factors \u2014 like your cancer type, stage and grade (how atypical the cells are) \u2014 that your provider can explain to you."

A surgeon makes three to five small cuts on both sides of your chest, between your ribs. A thoracoscopy is usually done as video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS). Your provider will insert a videoscope through one of the incisions to allow them to see your lungs. A thoracoscopy is less invasive than a sternotomy.\n*Sternotomy. During a median sternotomy, a surgeon cuts through your breastbone to open your chest. A surgeon can access both lungs through the same incision with this approach.

Chest x-rays and high-resolution CT scans (computed tomography scans) can help your provider know if a large amount of air is trapped in your lungs, and where the worst damage is.\n*Pulmonary function tests. LVRS might be more likely to help people with an FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second) of less than 45% on spirometry tests.\n*Exercise tests. A metabolic exercise stress test (cardiopulmonary exercise test) and six-minute walk test can help your provider understand the level of exercise you can tolerate.\n*Lung diffusion test. Your provider may want you to have a DLCO (diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide) that\u2019s above 20% of the predicted value.\n*Cardiac (heart) tests. An electrocardiogram (EKG), an ultrasound of your heart (echocardiogram) and a stress test can help your provider understand how well your heart is working.\n*Ventilation/perfusion scan (V/Q scan) and arterial blood gas tests. These tests can give your provider additional information about how well your respiratory system is working.",

There are also many ways to reconstruct your breast(s) following removal. These are some of the discussions you\u2019ll have with your healthcare provider. As you map out your breast cancer treatment plan together, you\u2019ll have a series of choices to make.\nThe decision to have a mastectomy is a very personal one that often brings on a lot of different emotions. You may feel anxious and ready to take whatever steps are needed to remove the tumor. At the same time, you may feel sad about losing your breast to cancer. You may feel like you\u2019re losing part of your identity. All of these are normal emotional reactions that your healthcare provider will understand.",

                            "body": "Mastectomies go by different names depending on how much tissue your surgeon removes:\n*Partial mastectomy (lumpectomy): This procedure removes an individual tumor (\u201clump\u201d) from your breast, with a margin of healthy tissue around it. A lumpectomy is an option when treating breast cancer in the early stages.\n*Total mastectomy (simple mastectomy): A total or simple mastectomy removes all breast tissue but leaves your pectoral muscles beneath. A total mastectomy can be unilateral (one breast only) or bilateral (both breasts).\n*Double mastectomy (bilateral mastectomy): A double mastectomy, also called a bilateral mastectomy, is a total mastectomy of both breasts. You may have a double mastectomy if you have cancer in both breasts or if you have a high risk of cancer occurring in both breasts.\n*Skin-sparing mastectomy or nipple-sparing mastectomy: A skin-sparing or nipple-sparing mastectomy removes your breast tissue but spares the skin and/or nipple to use when reconstructing your breast.\n*Mastectomy with breast reconstruction: Whether or not you're having a skin-sparing or nipple-sparing mastectomy, you may be able to have breast reconstruction surgery at the same time as your mastectomy. This will depend on your condition and treatment plan. You can also have breast reconstruction later in a separate surgery. Your breast reconstruction surgery may include nipple and areola reconstruction.\n*Modified radical mastectomy: A modified radical mastectomy removes all of your breast tissue, as well as your underarm lymph nodes on the same side. This is often the first place that breast cancer spreads.\n*Radical mastectomy: A radical mastectomy removes all of your breast tissue, underarm lymph nodes and your pectoral muscles underneath. This surgery is rare these days, but it may be necessary if the cancer has spread to your muscles.",

                    "body": "You and your healthcare provider will develop a treatment plan that includes the kind of mastectomy and any reconstructive surgery that you\u2019ll have. This discussion is a good time to learn what you should expect during your recovery. Understanding what goes into recovering from a mastectomy will help you plan how to manage your daily activities after your surgery.\nFor example, your provider may tell you to restrict your activities as you recover. They may explain that you won\u2019t be able to lift your arms over your head, so you may want to reorganize your shelves and place essential items on lower shelves. They may tell you that won\u2019t be able to lift anything heavier than a gallon of milk, so you should plan to have help at hand.\nYou may want to contact local breast cancer support groups. Talking to someone about their mastectomy experience may help you feel less anxious about your mastectomy and recovery.\nThere are some other things you should do to get ready for your surgery, including:\n*Quit smoking: Smoking affects your blood flow, which can make it harder for you to heal after surgery. You may not be considered for reconstruction if you\u2019re actively smoking or using nicotine (vaping).\n*Fast: For example, your surgeon may say you can\u2019t eat anything for at least six hours before surgery. You may be able to drink clear liquids for a certain amount of time before surgery. But be sure to double-check with your surgeon.\n*Plan for your hospital stay: A mastectomy is a major surgery. You\u2019ll probably be in the hospital overnight. Making plans for others to manage your work and home responsibilities means you can focus on healing.\n*Plan for help at home: You may want to have someone stay with you for the first few days at home. Consider asking family and friends to help with meals.",

                    "body": "\n*First, a healthcare provider will give you general anesthesia, which means you\u2019ll be asleep throughout the procedure.\n*You\u2019ll have a tube to help you breathe and a catheter in your vein to give you IV fluids. You may have a catheter to drain your urine if it\u2019s a longer procedure.\n*Your surgeon will clean and sterilize the surgical site and give you antibiotics through your IV to prevent infections.\n*You may have a mildly radioactive substance called a tracer injected into your breast to help highlight your nearby lymph nodes. Your surgeon will use a handheld scanner to find them.\n*Alternatively, your surgeon may inject a blue dye into your breast tissue to highlight your lymph nodes. The dye will stay in your tissues for a few weeks. It will turn your pee a different color for the first few days after your surgery.\n*Your surgeon will remove your breast tissue, including or sparing your skin and/or nipple. They may remove additional tissue if cancer has spread there.\n*Your surgeon may remove one or several lymph nodes from your underarm. They\u2019ll send them to the lab to check for cancer cells.\n*In some cases, your surgeon may do an axillary lymph node dissection to remove all the lymph nodes from your underarm.\n*Your surgeon may begin and complete the process of reconstructing your breast at this time. They may use an artificial implant, temporary implant and/or tissue from somewhere else on your body.\n*If you\u2019re not having breast reconstruction at this time, they\u2019ll close the opening. You may have reconstruction surgery later, or you may choose not to have it.\n*Your surgeon will most likely leave a temporary drain inside the surgical site. This is a tube that draws excess fluids from the wound into a collection bulb on the outside. You may have it for a week or two afterward.",

Your healthcare team will check the breast tissue and lymph nodes they removed to ensure they got all the cancer. They\u2019ll usually have your results within a couple of weeks. Most of the time, there\u2019s no need for additional surgery. But occasionally, they may need to remove additional lymph nodes or a wider margin of tissue in the area.\nYou may also need additional cancer treatment after surgery like radiation or chemotherapy. Some people prefer to complete these treatments before beginning the process of breast reconstruction. Even if you\u2019ve begun your breast reconstruction, you might need additional follow-up surgeries (revision surgery) to achieve the final cosmetic result you want.",

But some complications develop later.\nEarly complications from the procedure can include:\n*Surgical wound infection: Surgeons are careful to prevent this and give you antibiotics at surgery. The risk is less than 1%.\n*Hematoma: This rare complication involves a buildup of blood under the surgical wound. This occasionally means removing this buildup of blood in the operating room.\n*Seroma: This happens when fluid builds up inside your surgical wound. It can cause swelling and tenderness at the surgery site. This may need to be drained in the office.\n*Flap necrosis: This complication involves loss of blood supply to the cut tissue, leading to tissue death. It would require cutting off the dead tissue and possibly replacing it with a skin graft. The risk of flap necrosis is low.\nDelayed complications can include:\n*Post-mastectomy pain syndrome (PMPS): PMPS is when you have nerve damage that may happen if your surgeon needs to take tissue close to your underarm. This condition causes symptoms like tingling, prickling, burning, itching or shooting pain. Talk to your surgeon if you have these symptoms. They can prescribe nerve pain medication.\n*Lymphedema: This happens if your surgery involves removing many lymph nodes and damages your lymphatic system.",

In breast cancer reconstruction, your surgeon will take steps to hide your scars as much as possible.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nIf tests show you have breast cancer, you might consider a mastectomy to eliminate cancer. If you\u2019re at risk of developing breast cancer, you may want this surgery to reduce your cancer risk. Either way, you\u2019re making a life-changing choice when you\u2019re contemplating this procedure.

                    "question": "Who is a candidate for minimally invasive surgery?",
                    "body": "In many aspects, minimally invasive surgery is safer than traditional open surgery. In fact, some people who aren\u2019t candidates for traditional open surgery may be candidates for minimally invasive procedures. However, minimally invasive techniques can take longer than open surgery, and they require some preparation in advance. This may not work in an emergency, or when your condition isn\u2019t yet clear.\nPeople with certain heart and lung conditions may not be ideal candidates for laparoscopic surgery in particular. This is because laparoscopic surgery involves pumping gases into your abdominal cavity to separate your abdominal wall from your organs. In some people, these gases may increase the risk of heart and lung complications during surgery. Your surgeon will assess your risk on an individual basis."

                {
                    "question": "What happens in minimally invasive surgery?",
                    "body": "Different types of surgical procedures involve different steps. However, there are some general differences between traditional open surgery and minimally invasive surgery procedures.\n*Anesthesia: While open surgery almost always requires general anesthesia, some minimally invasive procedures don\u2019t. You may only need local anesthesia at the incision site, with or without sedation to help you relax. If you\u2019re having endoscopic surgery, you may not need anesthesia at all. A numbing agent in your throat can help the endoscope pass through without triggering your choking reflex.\n*Incisions: The hallmark of minimally invasive surgery is small incisions, if any. These small incisions for endoscopes and surgical instruments are typically a half-inch long or less. An incision might be slightly larger if your surgeon needs to remove an organ through it \u2014 or smaller, if it\u2019s in your brain or vascular system. Smaller incisions make for an easier recovery, with less pain and less risk of complications.\n*Operating and recovery time: In general, operations take longer when surgeons use minimally invasive methods because there are many more steps, tools and helpers involved. This is especially true for robotic surgery. On the other hand, the recovery time tends to be much faster. You can often go home the same day as your procedure, and your smaller incision wounds heal in weeks rather than months.",

                    "question": "What tools or equipment are used in minimally invasive surgery?",
                    "body": "Minimally invasive surgery requires specialized tools and equipment, which require specialized training to use. In addition to the surgeon, it takes a well-trained surgical team to help manage it all. The surgical team helps monitor the machines and make adjustments to the equipment during surgery. They stay by the operating table to help place instruments when the surgeon operates from the robotic console.\nSome of the equipment they use includes:\n*Endoscopes. Endoscopes are long, narrow tubes with a lighted video camera at the end. They come in different sizes for looking inside different body cavities. They can be rigid or flexible.\n*Imaging equipment. Monitors project video from the endoscope during surgery. Surgeons often use other imaging technology to locate the surgical site, such as ultrasound or fluoroscopy.\n*Endovascular catheters. These tiny catheters travel through blood vessels. Surgeons use guidewires and X-ray imaging to guide them to the surgical site, and then operate through them.\n*Trocars. Trocars are tubes that the surgical team places within your keyhole incisions (ports). They place the other surgical instruments, including endoscopes, through the trocars.\n*Insufflators. Insufflators deliver low-pressure carbon dioxide gas through a tube into your body cavity. Surgeons use insufflators when they need to inflate your cavity for visibility and access.\n*Balloons. When surgeons don\u2019t want or need to inflate your entire body cavity, they might use an inflatable balloon to make space to operate just where they need it. They place the balloon at the end of a trocar, endoscope or catheter and inflate it by pumping gas through the tube.\n*Surgical instruments. Minimally invasive surgical instruments are long and narrow to operate within narrow spaces. Surgeons manipulate them through trocars, endoscopes or catheters.\n*Da Vinci Surgical System. The da Vinci Surgical System is the robotic system that surgeons use in robotic surgery. It includes an operating console, a separate video screen and an equipment cart that holds the surgical instruments and camera. The console operates four robotic arms.",

MMR stands for:\n*M \u2014 Measles: Measles causes fever, cough, a red rash and red eyes. It can lead to severe complications like pneumonia, seizures and encephalitis, a serious brain infection.\n*M \u2014 Mumps: Mumps causes headache, muscle aches, fatigue and painful swelling in certain salivary glands. It can lead to deafness, encephalitis and other serious complications.\n*R \u2014 Rubella: Rubella causes fever, sore throat and a rash that typically starts on your face and spreads to the rest of your body. It can cause severe illnesses in newborns of people who had rubella while pregnant.\nThe MMR vaccine is a combination vaccine. That means it contains more than one vaccine in a single shot. Children ages 12 months to 12 years may also receive the MMR vaccine combined with the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine in one shot called the MMRV. Your child\u2019s healthcare provider will help you decide which vaccine your child should get.",

They should receive a second dose between the ages of 4 and 6 years old.\n*College students: If you have a child going off to college and you\u2019re not sure if they have immunity, they should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart.\n*Adults: If you\u2019re not sure if you have immunity, you should receive at least one dose of the MMR vaccine. Some adults may need two doses. If you\u2019re going to be in a setting with a high risk for measles or mumps transmission, you should receive two doses of the vaccine at least 28 days apart. These adults include college students, healthcare workers and international travelers.\n*International travelers: People age 6 months and older should receive the MMR vaccine before traveling internationally. Babies between the ages of 6 and 11 months should receive one dose of the vaccine. Then, they should receive two more doses according to the typical schedule.\n*Healthcare providers: If you\u2019re a healthcare provider and you\u2019re not sure if you have immunity, you should receive two doses of the MMR vaccine at least 28 days apart.\nOther groups of people who may need the MMR vaccine include:\n*People of childbearing age: Before you get pregnant, check with your healthcare provider to make sure you have immunity against measles, mumps and rubella. If you\u2019re not sure, you should receive at least one dose of the vaccine. Also, it\u2019s safe for people who are breastfeeding (chest feeding) to receive the MMR vaccine.\n*People at an increased risk for mumps during a mumps outbreak: Public health authorities may recommend another dose of the vaccine for certain people during a mumps outbreak. These people include those who may have close contact with a person who has mumps.",

Then, they use a piece of your small intestine to create a new bladder (urinary diversion) in the same location as your original bladder.\u00a0\nNot everyone is a candidate for neobladder reconstruction surgery. Your healthcare team will determine your candidacy according to several factors, including how healthy your liver and kidneys are and whether you have urethral cancer.\nAnother name for neobladder reconstruction is orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. \u201cOrthotopic\u201d means the neobladder will be in the same position in your body as your original bladder.",

Certain medications can increase your risk of significant blood loss during surgery, including:\n*Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\n*Acetaminophen (Tylenol\u00ae).\n*Blood thinners (anticoagulants).\n*Certain herbal supplements.\nBe sure to check with a provider before you stop taking any medications.\nYou should also tell the provider about all of your known allergies. These include:\n*Medications.\n*Skin cleaners, like chlorhexidine, iodine or isopropyl alcohol.\n*Latex.\n*Foods.\nYou\u2019ll also receive specific directions on eating and drinking before neobladder reconstruction surgery.

Electrolytes normally leave your body when you pee. But your neobladder consists of part of your small intestine, and your small intestine absorbs electrolytes. Your neobladder may reabsorb them and cause electrolyte imbalances in your blood.\nYour small intestine also creates mucus.

Pee continually exits your body through a small opening (stoma) in your belly into a urostomy bag.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nNeobladder reconstruction involves removing your bladder and replacing it with a new one that a surgeon makes from a small part of your intestine. A provider may recommend neobladder reconstruction to treat bladder cancer, decompensated bladder or another condition that affects your bladder. It may take a few months to fully recover, and you\u2019ll likely have to adjust to new habits or routines until your body heals and your neobladder stretches. But a neobladder can increase your overall comfort and well-being. Reach out to a healthcare provider if you have any questions or concerns."

Collagen is a protein in your body that gives your skin, tissues and bones structure and shape.\u00a0\n*Sculptra: Sculptra is a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dermal filler made of a gel-like substance (poly-L-lactic acid). A healthcare provider will inject Sculptra under your skin to give your buttocks area a fuller and smoother look. It may take four to six weeks to see full results after a Sculptra injection.\n*Laser therapy: Lasers and intense pulsed lights can cosmetically rejuvenate areas of your body that show signs of age with wrinkles. This noninvasive procedure uses pulses of medical-grade, focused light on an area of your skin that you want to improve. The laser lights target areas of your buttocks where adipose fat cells cluster and break them up.",

Avoid over-exercising or participating in strenuous activities for a couple of days.\nYou may have temporary skin discoloration like redness or bruising at the injection site or the site of your laser therapy. These side effects should reduce and go away after a few days. If you experience mild pain after your procedure, you can treat it with over-the-counter NSAIDs. Visit your healthcare provider if you have severe pain or swelling.",

                    "body": "Before your surgery, you\u2019ll receive anesthesia to numb your body and make sure you don\u2019t feel any pain. An anesthesiologist will give you either general anesthesia to put you to sleep during the surgery or regional anesthesia to numb the area around your broken bone. They may give you other medications to make you sleep if you need regional anesthesia.\nORIF gets its name from the two parts of the surgery:\n*Open reduction: Open reduction means a surgeon makes cuts (incisions) in your skin to access your broken bone and put the pieces back to their natural positions. Open is the medical term for surgery that requires incisions to open your body to let your surgeon see inside it. A reduction is the process of repositioning the pieces of your bone.\n*Internal fixation: This is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 your surgeon will put pieces of metal into your bone (internally) to hold (fixate) it in place. They\u2019ll use rods, screws, wires, plates or a combination of these fasteners to secure the pieces of your broken bone back together.\nDuring ORIF surgery, your surgeon will:\n*Make incisions in your skin around the broken bone.\n*Set your bone and realign the broken pieces.\n*Perform the internal fixation to hold the pieces of bone in place. How they do this depends on which type of fracture you have. For example, they might put a long titanium rod through the center of a long bone like your shin bone (if you have a tibia fracture), or screw metal plates into either side of your ankle to repair a broken ankle.\n*Close the incisions.\n*Immobilize your bone. Most people will need a cast. You might only need a splint after ORIF. It depends on which bone is broken.",

You\u2019ll probably need to wear a cast or splint for a least a few weeks. Talk to your provider or surgeon about what to expect while you recover.\nYour surgeon will give you a customized recovery plan, but in general, you should:\n*Elevate your bone: Keep your bone above the level of your heart as often as possible. You can prop it up on cushions or pillows while lying down.\n*Keep your incision clean and covered: Follow your surgeon\u2019s incision care instructions carefully to prevent infections. Ask your surgeon when you should change the dressing on your incision site (if you can access it) and when it\u2019s safe to take a shower or bathe, especially if you\u2019re wearing a cast.\n*Physical therapy: You\u2019ll work with a physical therapist for up to a few months after your surgery. Your surgeon will give you instructions on how to move safely before you go home. You might need to use crutches or other assistive devices for a few weeks after ORIF.",

You might need follow-up surgeries to remove them. Ask your surgeon what to expect.\nIt\u2019s common for screws and plates around joints (especially your ankles) to stay in your bone for the rest of your life. The metal pieces will support your bones even after the fracture heals.\nSometimes, as your bone heals, your body pushes screws or other fasteners closer to your skin\u2019s surface.

Sometimes, people call this cracking your chest. Your surgeon may recommend an open procedure if you\u2019re strong enough to tolerate it.\nIf open-heart surgery isn\u2019t right for you, your surgeon can do many kinds of heart surgery through\u00a0smaller, less invasive incisions.

Anesthesia is safer on an empty stomach.\n*Smoking and alcohol:\u00a0Cut back on alcohol and\u00a0quit smoking. Both can slow your healing after surgery and increase your risk of complications.\n*Illness: Stay away from people who are sick in the two weeks before your surgery.

The machine circulates blood through your body while moving blood away from your heart. The surgeon then operates on a heart that isn\u2019t beating and doesn\u2019t have blood flow. After surgery, the surgeon disconnects the device and your heart starts to work again.\n*Off-pump:\u00a0Off-pump bypass surgery\u00a0takes place on a heart that continues to beat on its own. This approach only works for\u00a0coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Your surgeon may call this beating-heart surgery.",

Thanks to medical advances, surgeons can now use\u00a0minimally invasive heart surgery\u00a0or small incisions to perform many procedures that once required them to open your chest. The surgeon sometimes still needs to cut through part of your breastbone.\nDepending on your situation, your surgeon may be able to use these methods:\n*Catheter-based:\u00a0Your surgeon threads a catheter (thin, hollow tube) to your heart. Then they insert surgical instruments, balloons or stents through the catheter to perform a procedure. Catheter-based procedures include\u00a0transcatheter aortic valve replacement\u00a0(TAVR) and\u00a0coronary angioplasty and stenting.\n*Video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS):\u00a0Your surgeon performs\u00a0VATS\u00a0by inserting a tiny video camera (thoracoscope) and surgical instruments into several small chest incisions. They may use VATS to place a pacemaker, repair heart valves or treat an arrhythmia.\n*Robotically assisted:\u00a0Certain people with heart valve disease, cardiac tumors, atrial fibrillation and septal defects (holes in the heart) may be candidates for this minimally invasive approach. A surgeon controls the robotic arms that perform the surgery.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nIt\u2019s normal to have concerns before having major surgery like open-heart surgery. But your surgeon has a plan and a team of people to help them carry it out. Don\u2019t hesitate to share questions and concerns with your healthcare provider. They want you to understand how you can prepare and make this experience the best it can be for yourself.",

                    "body": "Healthcare providers use orchiectomies to:\n*Treat cancer:\u00a0Orchiectomy is both a diagnostic tool and type of treatment for testicular cancer. The surgery removes the tissues that may contain cancer, and also allows the\u00a0pathologist\u00a0to examine the tissue to make an accurate cancer diagnosis. It\u2019s also a treatment for\u00a0male breast cancer\u00a0and\u00a0prostate cancer. Androgens (male hormones like testosterone) encourage some cancer cells to grow. Without your testicles, hormone levels drop. An orchiectomy shrinks some cancerous tumors by cutting off the hormones that help them grow and spread.\n*Help transgender people transition:\u00a0As part of the transition process, many transgender women (or trans women) choose to have an orchiectomy. Healthcare providers may do this procedure as a single surgery. Or they may perform it as part of comprehensive gender affirmation surgery that includes a vaginoplasty or scrotoplasty. In addition to physical changes, removing both testicles greatly reduces male hormone levels in your body.\n*Remove damaged testicles:\u00a0Sports injuries, motorcycle accidents and other trauma can cause severe damage to your testicles. If a healthcare provider can\u2019t repair your testicle, they remove it and stitch up surrounding tissues. In rare cases, providers may need to remove an\u00a0undescended testicle. Also in rare cases, a provider may need to remove a testicle after a testicular torsion.",

Use soap and water when you shower and keep the area clean and dry. You may need to wear a special garment to support your scrotum for about 48 hours after surgery to reduce swelling.

These symptoms can occur after a drop in hormone levels. Talk to your healthcare provider about taking hormone supplements, which may relieve these symptoms.",

It\u2019s normal to have questions about the surgery, no matter what the reason is for having it. Be sure to discuss the procedure with your healthcare provider so you know exactly what to expect. Your provider will go over the risks and benefits of the surgery as well as how you can best recover after surgery."

During the procedure, a surgeon creates a small opening in your belly (stoma). This opening goes from an area inside your body to the outside of your abdomen.\nThe purpose of an ostomy is to change the way pee or poop exits your body. After ostomy surgery, waste drains from inside your body to the outside \u2014 and collects in a pouch, or an ostomy bag.\nWhile the term \u201costomy\u201d refers to the procedure, \u201cstoma\u201d refers to the actual opening in your belly.

This can occur when foods that are difficult to digest become stuck in your gastrointestinal tract. Blockages can usually clear on their own when you drink clear liquids to temporarily rest your bowel.\n*Electrolyte imbalance. Your large intestine absorbs water, electrolytes and nutrients from the foods you eat. If your ostomy bypasses your large intestine, it can cause a dehydration and/or an electrolyte imbalance. Ask your healthcare provider how to maintain electrolyte balance after an ostomy.\n*Hernia. If your abdominal wall becomes weak around your stoma, you could develop a hernia. Stoma hernias often require surgical correction once they\u2019ve become too large.\n*Narrowing of the stoma. If your stoma becomes narrowed, it can be difficult for waste to pass through it. This condition often requires surgical repair.\n*Phantom rectum syndrome. If rectum removal was part of your procedure, you might still feel the need to make a bowel movement. This condition usually resolves on its own. However, if you have pain associated with phantom rectum syndrome, your healthcare provider can prescribe pain relievers.\n*Prolapse. Sometimes, your bowel pushes itself out through the stoma like an accordion. In some cases, a surgeon can push the bowel back in to its place. In other instances, you might need a larger ostomy pouch or surgical correction.",

Your peritoneum covers your abdominal organs, including your stomach, liver, kidney and parts of your intestines. It consists of two layers. Ascites form when fluid builds up between the two layers, a place called your peritoneal cavity.\nDuring paracentesis, a healthcare provider uses a needle and a plastic tube called a catheter to drain the ascites. Draining the fluid can relieve unpleasant symptoms like pressure in your abdomen. Sometimes healthcare providers drain the fluid to run tests on it. Test results show what\u2019s causing ascites.",

You may need to pee beforehand so your bladder is empty for the procedure.\nOnce you\u2019re ready, a healthcare provider will:\n*Position you. Chances are, you\u2019ll be on your back. The bed may be completely flat, or it may be slightly raised to lift your head.\n*Clean and numb the area where the needle will go. You\u2019ll get a small injection of medicine that prevents you from feeling any pain. You may feel a quick prick when the needle goes in.\n*Insert the needle and catheter. Your provider will insert the needle in the numbed area, above the ascites. Many providers use an ultrasound while inserting the needle. Ultrasounds show fluid buildup in your body (like ascites), so your provider knows exactly where the needle should go. They\u2019ll place a plastic catheter tube into the site to help the fluid drain.\n*Drain the ascites. They may use a syringe or a vacuum-powered container to collect the fluid. They\u2019re more likely to use a vacuum container with suction power if they\u2019re draining several liters of fluid. This makes the process go faster.\n*Remove the needle and bandage the site. They\u2019ll remove the needle and apply pressure to the site to stop bleeding. They\u2019ll bandage the area.\nIf ascites frequently return after paracentesis, your provider may place a tube called a tunneled peritoneal drainage catheter into the drainage site. You\u2019ll wear this tube long-term, so you won\u2019t have to keep returning for paracentesis. Part of the tube goes inside your abdomen, and the other side goes outside. The outside part attaches to a bottle that continually collects fluid. You\u2019ll drain the bottle at home.\nYour healthcare provider will advise you on whether this is a good option.",

Contact your provider if you see signs of infection, like redness or swelling at the drainage site.\n*Food. You may need to work with a dietitian to get on a low-sodium diet if you\u2019re not on one already. Too much sodium causes you to retain fluid.\n*Drink. If you\u2019re not already doing so, you may need to take water pills. They help flush excess salt and water out of your body so you don\u2019t develop ascites.\n*Hygiene.

It can also help relieve symptoms if you\u2019re living with a condition causing ascites. Paracentesis may be a one-time procedure, depending on your condition, or you may need it frequently. Your provider may need to remove a small amount of fluid if they\u2019re trying to diagnose a condition but a larger amount if you have recurring ascites. Ask about what factors will shape your experience before going in for paracentesis so you know what to expect."

After birth, when your lungs are working, this opening usually closes. When it stays open, it usually doesn\u2019t cause issues. But in some cases, it does.

                    "body": "A PFO (patent foramen ovale) closure plugs an opening between your heart\u2019s two upper chambers by putting in a permanent device. A healthcare provider can do this using a catheter (a long, thin, flexible, hollow tube) that they get to your heart through a large vein elsewhere in your body.\nYour provider can use a closure device to plug the opening. These devices have a wire frame that consists of a nickel-titanium metal alloy with synthetic material around it. Some look like a yo-yo, with two round disks and a narrow middle. Each round disk covers one side of the hole in your heart.\nWithin a few days of receiving a PFO closure device, your body\u2019s own tissue will start to grow over and around it. Three to six months later, your heart tissue completely covers the device. At that point, it becomes a part of your heart wall.\nIf you have a PFO larger than 25 millimeters, a provider will probably do PFO closure surgery instead of using the catheter method. This is rare.",

These may include sore throat, nausea and vomiting, constipation, severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and stroke.\n*Bacterial infection. Harmful bacteria can enter your body through your open wounds and cause sepsis.\n*Partial phallic loss. Your neophallus must have adequate blood flow.

Scar tissue can slow or completely block pee from leaving your body.\n*Urinary fistula. An abnormal connection or opening may form between your urinary system and a nearby organ, like your intestines (bowel). A urinary fistula may also open to the outside of your body.\n*Dribbling pee.

        "Introduction": "Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a laser eye surgery similar to LASIK. Unlike LASIK, which involves opening a flap in your cornea, PRK removes your cornea so that it grows back naturally. That makes it a better laser eye surgery choice for some people who can\u2019t undergo LASIK.",

                    "body": "Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a laser surgery procedure to correct your eyesight. The laser makes small changes to the shape of your cornea, the clear, protective layer at the front of your eye. Reshaping your cornea affects how it bends light, which changes how you see.\nPRK is a predecessor of laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). After the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved PRK in 1996, PRK was the preferred laser surgery for correcting vision. In 1999, the FDA approved LASIK, which has certain advantages that helped it become more popular than PRK. But PRK is still a useful and common treatment, and there are some situations where it does things LASIK can\u2019t.",

                            "body": "Your cornea is one of the most important parts of your eye when it comes to how your eye focuses light onto the retina inside. The cornea and lens refract (bend) light rays so they converge precisely on the retina. When light rays don\u2019t converge at the right point, that\u2019s called a refractive error.\nWhen you wear corrective lenses (glasses or contacts), they bend light more than your eyes can on their own. That\u2019s how corrective lenses help with refractive errors.\nBut sometimes, people want or need vision correction that\u2019s stronger than what glasses or contacts can provide, or they can\u2019t or would rather not wear corrective lenses. That\u2019s where vision correction surgeries like PRK come in. It can reduce how much you rely on corrective lenses or eliminate your need for them altogether.\nPRK can treat all four of the main types of refractive errors:\n*Nearsightedness (myopia).\n*Farsightedness (hyperopia).\n*Astigmatism.\n*Presbyopia.",

                    "question": "What happens during a PRK procedure?",
                    "body": "PRK is an outpatient procedure, which means you go home shortly after it\u2019s over. The entire procedure takes between five and 15 minutes. You\u2019ll be awake for this procedure and your eye care specialist will use numbing drops on your eyes so you won\u2019t feel pain.\nOnce your eyes are numb, your eye care specialist will remove the epithelium, the outermost layer of your cornea. (It\u2019ll grow back within several days.) They can do that with a laser, special tools or liquid solution. Feeling slight pressure on your eye surface is normal during this part, but it won\u2019t hurt.\nOnce they remove the corneal epithelium, they\u2019ll have you look toward a target light on the laser device. Having you look at a target makes for more precise shape changes, and most lasers help with this by tracking the position of the eye during the treatment. \nOnce you\u2019re looking at the target light, they\u2019ll begin using the laser. The beam is invisible, but you may hear a tapping or clicking sound from the device creating the beam. The beam ablates (removes) corneal tissue without heating it. Thinning specific areas of the cornea will change the shape of it after your epithelium grows back.\nIf you\u2019re worried about keeping your eyes still during this part, communicate with your eye care specialist. They can stop the laser if you do have trouble keeping your eyes still. And many modern PRK lasers detect changes in your eye position and stop themselves if your eyes move too far. Smaller eye movements usually aren\u2019t enough for the laser to cause negative effects.\nOnce the laser part of the procedure is over, your eye care specialist will add additional medicated drops to your eye (if necessary) and place a bandage contact lens on the eye. Bandage lenses protect your eye while the outer cornea layers regenerate."

                            "body": "After you have everything from your provider, you can go home. Some things to keep in mind once you do go home include:\n*Take it easy. Rest during the first few days. Physical activity may interfere with how your cornea heals, so don\u2019t do it unless your provider says it\u2019s OK. Taking time off work or school for a few days is a good idea, too.\n*Don\u2019t drive. Most people will need to avoid driving for at least a few days after PRK.\n*Follow prescription and care instructions exactly. Take your medications and use bandage contact lenses exactly as recommended. Following your provider\u2019s instructions precisely improves your odds of a good outcome.\n*Wear sunglasses as recommended. Wearing sunglasses keeps UV rays from causing corneal scarring and damage. You should do this whenever you go outside during the daytime for as long as your eye care specialist says you need to."

When they do happen, they\u2019re often minor, temporary or both.\n*It\u2019s effective. Most people end up with vision that\u2019s within 0.50 diopters of their goal, an amount that most people wouldn\u2019t wear glasses for.\n*It can treat several issues. PRK can treat nearsightedness, farsightedness and astigmatism. It can also create monovision (treating one eye to make it better for focusing far away and treating the other so it\u2019s good at focusing up close). Monovision is a possible treatment for presbyopia.\n*It limits corneal shape changes to very specific areas. LASIK involves opening a flap in the cornea across a wider and deeper area. If you have corneas with an unusual shape or that are thin, PRK can reduce the amount of shape-changing of your cornea without compromising the outcome. "

But PRK is better than LASIK for some people.\nPRK may be the better option when:\n*You have dry eyes. Creating the flap for LASIK can disrupt the nerve connections in your corneas that help with moisture. Avoiding the LASIK flap helps with eye moisture and other issues.\n*You have thin corneas. Creating a corneal flap is riskier if you have thin corneas. If cutting into the cornea to make the flap goes too deep, it can damage deeper layers of the cornea, leading to unwanted complications.\n*You\u2019re very active. This can cause a flap to dislodge after you have LASIK. Eye injuries after PRK are less likely to cause complications than after LASIK. That\u2019s because the flap can reopen and come loose after it heals under certain circumstances.\nBut LASIK is more popular than PRK overall for a few reasons:\n*It has a faster recovery.\n*It usually involves less pain.\n*PRK requires taking some medications for several weeks to lower your risk of certain complications.\nBecause there are so many factors that play into these procedures, there\u2019s no one procedure that\u2019s better for everyone.

Others may need further treatment to resolve them. Your eye care specialist can tell you more about what to expect and what\u2019s most likely to help.\nSimilar to LASIK, PRK may damage your eyes and make your vision worse. Fortunately, that\u2019s extremely rare."

                    "body": "If you decide you want to pursue PRK and your specialist clears you for it, they\u2019ll talk to you about payment. Unlike many eye care procedures, insurance policies usually don\u2019t cover laser vision correction surgery. You\u2019ll likely have to pay the full cost out of pocket. Some optical/vision insurance carriers may still offer discounts with specialists who do PRK. You\u2019ll still need to pay the entire amount, but the amount may be lower.\nOnce you complete all those steps, your eye care specialist or their staff will schedule a time and date for you to have the procedure. You\u2019ll also want to arrange for someone to drive you to and from the procedure.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nPRK may be a better option for some people who want laser vision surgery but have greater risks from LASIK. For more than 25 years, PRK has been a key laser correction procedure. Along the way, technological advances have improved it further, making it even safer and more effective.\nIf you\u2019re unable to have LASIK but are still open to another laser vision surgery, PRK may be able to help you. While it\u2019s not a magic fix, it has very high odds of improving your vision. Most importantly, don\u2019t forget to be realistic about your expectations. PRK may not fix your vision completely, but if it improves your eyesight and lowers how much you rely on glasses or contacts, it can still bring big benefits to your life."

                    "body": "A proctectomy is a surgical procedure to remove all or part of your rectum. Your rectum consists of the last six inches of your large intestine located just above your anus. In some cases, the procedure may include removing your anal opening as well.\nThere are a few reasons why a proctectomy might be necessary:\n*Rectal cancer: This is the most common reason for a proctectomy.\n*Severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease (inflammatory bowel disease): If medication and other treatments haven\u2019t helped manage these conditions, a proctectomy may be necessary.\n*Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP): This is a genetic condition that causes polyps to form in your colon and rectum. These polyps can become cancerous, so your provider may recommend a proctectomy to prevent cancer.\nA proctectomy is a major surgery, and there are some risks associated with it, like infection, bleeding and sexual dysfunction. But it can be a life-saving surgery for people with rectal cancer or severe inflammatory bowel disease.",

This is essential to ensure your bowels are completely clean and cleared out before surgery. Your provider will prescribe a specific bowel prep regimen, which may involve changes to your medications and what you eat. You may also need to take laxatives or enemas.\nYou may need to stop taking certain medications, like blood thinners, before surgery. Discuss all medications with your provider to receive specific instructions.\nSmoking can slow healing after a proctectomy and increase your risk of complications.

                    "question": "What happens during a proctectomy?",
                    "body": "First, an anesthesiologist will give you general anesthesia. This will make you fall asleep so you don\u2019t feel anything during the procedure.\nThe type of proctectomy you have will depend on the reason for the surgery and the location and size of the problem in your rectum. There are three main types of proctectomy:\n*Abdominoperineal resection (APR): This is the most extensive proctectomy, removing your entire rectum, anus and sphincter muscles. Due to the removal of your sphincter muscles, you\u2019ll need an ostomy to remove waste from your body. An ostomy is an opening created surgically, either in your ileum (lower part of your small intestine) called an ileostomy or in your colon called a colostomy. You then attach an external pouch to the opening to collect waste. You\u2019ll need to empty this pouch regularly. Providers typically perform APR when the cancer is located very low in your rectum or has spread to your sphincter muscles.\n*Low anterior resection (LAR): This surgery targets the lower portion of your rectum, aiming to preserve your sphincter muscles when possible. Depending on the remaining function of your rectum and what your surgeon recommends, you may or may not need an ostomy. If you don\u2019t need an ostomy, your surgeon will reconnect your remaining rectum to your anus (anastomosis) to allow poop to go through the natural passage. LAR is generally preferred over APR when possible because it avoids the need for an ostomy and its associated lifestyle adjustments.\n*Robotic-assisted rectal resection: This is a minimally invasive approach to a LAR procedure. It uses robotic arms for greater precision and control during surgery. Your surgeon sits at a console and manipulates the robotic arms to perform the dissection and reconnection. Potential benefits of robotic-assisted surgery include less blood loss, faster recovery time and potentially improved surgical precision.",

Removing the cancerous rectum also lowers the risk of the cancer returning (recurring) in the future.\nIf you have severe ulcerative colitis or Crohn\u2019s disease that doesn't respond to medication, a proctectomy can significantly improve your quality of life. It can alleviate chronic pain, diarrhea and bleeding. Chronic inflammation associated with irritable bowel disease (IBD) can lead to complications like colon cancer.

But long-term management of an ostomy adds other things you need to worry about.\n*J-pouch surgery: If you have a j-pouch created, the recovery process is typically longer, as it involves additional adjustments to bowel function.\n*Your overall health: Underlying medical conditions or a weakened immune system can impact healing time.\nHere\u2019s a general timeframe for recovery:\n*Hospital stay: The average hospital stay after a proctectomy is typically three to seven days, barring any complications.\n*Initial recovery: The initial recovery period at home usually lasts for four to six weeks. During this time, you\u2019ll focus on wound healing, pain management, dietary adjustments and regaining strength.\n*Returning to normal activities: Gradually returning to your usual activities can take several months. It\u2019s important to avoid strenuous activity or heavy lifting for at least six weeks after surgery.",

You may also take a laxative, a medication that makes you have to poop.\nA proctoscopy looks at your rectum but not the other sections of your colon that are higher up, so the preparation isn\u2019t quite as complex for the procedure.",

The procedure will take place in an exam room or an endoscopy suite. A provider will ask you to remove your clothing below the waist and change into a hospital gown. Then, they\u2019ll ask you to bend over a short table or to lie on your left side with your knees bent.\nYour provider will first do a preliminary digital rectal exam with a gloved, lubricated finger. This is to look for tenderness or blockages. Then, they\u2019ll gently insert the lubricated proctoscope. As the scope is slowly and carefully passed through, you may feel as if you need to poop. This is typical.\nYour provider may pass air into your rectum to help better see the walls and any issues. You may experience some discomfort (cramping or fullness), but the test usually doesn\u2019t cause pain. Most proctoscopy examinations don\u2019t require anesthesia. But tell your provider if you need pain relief or if you're feeling nervous before the test.\nIt\u2019s not unusual to hear and feel some air escaping during this procedure. This is normal and expected, so don\u2019t be embarrassed.\nWhen the exam is over, your healthcare provider will gently remove the proctoscope.",

Your sigmoid is the last section of your colon. It connects to your rectum. A sigmoidoscope is longer than a proctoscope, so it can reach past your rectum and into your sigmoid colon. That means your provider can screen more of your colon during a flexible sigmoidoscopy than during a proctoscopy.\nA proctoscope measures about 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) long, so it only reaches the bottom part of your lower intestine. The scope used in a flexible sigmoidoscopy is about 27 inches (68.6 centimeters) long, so it allows your provider to view a much bigger area of your large intestine.",

BPH becomes more common as people assigned male at birth (AMAB) age. BPH is a noncancerous condition that causes your prostate to increase in size.\nYour prostate is a small, walnut-shaped gland that surrounds your urethra and provides additional fluid to your semen (ejaculate). It has five rounded segments (lobes):\n*One in the front (anterior).\n*One in the back (posterior).\n*Two on either side (lateral).\n*One in the middle (median).\nUrine (pee) and ejaculate leave your body through your urethra. If your prostate gets too big, it can make it difficult for pee and ejaculate to pass through your urethra.\nOther names for a prostatic urethral lift include:\n*PUL.\n*UroLift\u00ae.",

They may also order tests or procedures to help determine the size of your prostate and the severity of your BPH, including:\n*Urine flow test. This test measures the speed and strength of your pee stream. It also measures the amount of pee.\n*Post-void residual volume test. This test measures how much pee is still in your urinary bladder after you pee.\n*Transrectal ultrasound. A provider will insert a probe into your anus (butthole) to take images of your prostate. The probe uses high-energy sound waves, which travel through your rectum and bounce off organs and tissue in the area.\n*Cystoscopy. During a cystoscopy, a provider will insert a small, flexible tool with a camera and a light at the end of it (cystoscope) to see inside your urethra and bladder.\n*Urinalysis (urine test). A urine test evaluates how your pee looks, as well as any chemicals, bacteria or other microscopic components in your pee. If urinalysis shows bacteria in your pee (urinary tract infection or UTI), you may need to treat the infection before you can have a PUL.",

If you must take prescription medications by mouth, take them with a small sip of water.\nA PUL may take place in an office or at an ambulatory surgery center. You\u2019ll change into a hospital gown for the procedure, so it\u2019s a good idea to wear clothes that are easy to take off.\nThough a PUL is a minimally invasive procedure, it can be nerve-wracking whenever you go through a medical procedure. In most cases, a provider will give you a mild sedative to help you relax. It\u2019s a good idea to have a friend or family member drive you home after the procedure.",

The team typically includes a urologist (surgeon) and nurses.\nA nurse will lead you to a surgical table and instruct you to lie on your back. You\u2019ll lift your legs, spread them apart and bring them to rest in padded stirrups that keep your legs up and open (dorsal lithotomy position). This position allows your providers to see and access your urethra easily.\nIn most cases, a healthcare provider will give you local anesthesia. Local anesthesia numbs your urethra and the surrounding areas so you won\u2019t feel pain during the procedure.\nOnce you\u2019re numb, your surgical team will:\n*Place a urinary catheter to drain pee from your bladder.\n*Insert a cystoscope into your urethra and pass it through to your bladder to see inside your body as they perform the PUL.\n*Insert a device (UroLift) into your urethra and move it forward to the side walls of your prostate. The UroLift then uses a small needle to eject small, thin, stainless-steel implants into both sides of your prostate. The implants pull prostate tissue away to open your urethra. Depending on your prostate\u2019s size, your urologist may place two to six implants.",

It targets thyroid cells specifically to permanently destroy them. There\u2019s little exposure to the rest of your body\u2019s cells. Still, there are certain precautions you\u2019ll have to take because you can emit (give off) small amounts of radiation that could affect other people.\nYour thyroid gland needs iodine to make thyroid hormones. You typically get the iodine you need naturally through the foods you eat and iodized salt. In RAI therapy, your thyroid takes up radioactive iodine, which kills thyroid cells using radiation. It\u2019s a type of nuclear medicine treatment.\nHealthcare providers use iodine-131 for radioiodine therapy. It\u2019s available as oral capsules, an oral drinking solution and IV injections.",

It sits behind your vagina. The bulge happens when the tissue that separates your vagina and rectum gets thin and weak.\nWhen a healthcare provider repairs a rectocele, they fix the bulge and then use sutures (rows of surgical stitches) or a medical device that acts as an anchor to strengthen the wall between your vagina and rectum. A gynecologist, urologist or colorectal surgeon can perform a rectocele repair, depending on the technique and other issues that need to be addressed during the surgery.\nRectocele repair is also sometimes called posterior colporrhaphy.",

Ways to reduce your symptoms include:\n*Avoiding constipation by following a high-fiber diet (more than 25 grams of fiber per day) and drinking plenty of water each day. Talk to your provider about using stool softeners or other medications if you need to.\n*Avoiding straining during bowel movements and long periods of sitting on the toilet.\n*Strengthening your pelvic floor muscles with Kegel exercises.\n*Using a pessary, a device placed into your vagina to reduce the bulge.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nGetting surgery to repair a rectocele can give you symptom relief and improve your quality of life. If you\u2019ve tried nonsurgical options and they haven\u2019t worked, you may be ready for surgical repair.\nStill, rectocele repair is a major surgery and a big decision. You can expect to spend a few weeks recovering while you gradually return to your typical level of activity. Talk to your provider about all your options and ask them about any concerns you have, both before and after the procedure. They can help you make a plan that works best for your specific situation.",

        "Introduction": "Robotic surgery is a newer technique for repairing hernias. It\u2019s a minimally invasive procedure that\u2019s an alternative to traditional open surgery. During the procedure, your surgeon sits at a console and maneuvers the surgical instruments (robot) from the console. Advantages of robotic surgery include three-dimensional images of the inside of your abdomen, smaller scars, less pain and a faster recovery time.",

                    "body": "Robotic hernia surgery is a type of surgery that uses small cuts to treat hernias. A hernia is when an organ pushes through the muscle or tissue wall that contains it. Robotic hernia surgery puts the herniated organ back where it belongs and closes the muscles where the organs are pushing through, so you have a strong barrier.\nRobotic hernia surgery is sometimes called robotic-assisted laparoscopy. Unlike open surgery, which involves one large incision (cut), laparoscopic surgery and robotic surgery allow your surgeon to operate using a few small cuts. They insert a tiny scope with a camera that allows them to see your organs on a screen while they repair your hernia through the incisions. Fewer cuts usually mean less bleeding, less pain and a shorter recovery time.\nDuring a robotic hernia, your surgeon controls the robotic arms and instruments from a screen that\u2019s next to you. This technology allows your surgeon to make precise movements and repair difficult or complex hernias with small cuts rather than a large incision.",

Laparoscopic or robotic surgery isn\u2019t always the best option for your specific hernia. It depends on your unique case. Your surgeon will consider multiple factors, including:\n*The size of your hernia.\n*How complex the repair will be.\n*Whether this is your first hernia surgery or if it\u2019s to repair a hernia that\u2019s returned.\n*How well you tolerate anesthesia (laparoscopy usually requires general anesthesia).\n*If you need to have any scars or excess skin removed at the same time as hernia surgery.\nYour surgeon may also discuss available options if they find an occult (or hidden) hernia during surgery. These hernias don\u2019t show up during exams or ultrasounds, but your provider may find one while repairing your diagnosed hernia. According to research, surgeons find occult hernias in 16% of robotic inguinal hernia repairs.\nIt\u2019s important to have a plan in place in case your surgeon finds this type of hernia during surgery.",

Or you may need a Foley catheter to collect your urine during the repair.\nDuring the procedure, a surgeon sits at a console near your bedside that allows them to control the surgical instruments (robot) they use to operate.\nThe specific steps vary, but surgery generally goes like this:\n*You\u2019ll receive general anesthesia to put you to sleep so you don\u2019t feel any pain during surgery.\n*Your surgeon will make a few (usually three or four) incisions. They\u2019ll insert a thin, telescope-like instrument called a laparoscope into one of your incisions. The laparoscope connects to a video camera (smaller than a dime) that projects a detailed, three-dimensional view of your insides onto screens in the operating room.\n*Your surgeon will inflate your abdomen with a harmless gas (carbon dioxide), making it easier for them to see the internal structures they need to operate on.\n*Your surgeon will maneuver the robot to repair your hernia. Repair may involve stitching tissue together and using mesh to reinforce the tissue.\n*Once the repair is complete, your surgeon will close your incisions with sutures or staples.",

                    "body": "It depends. Robotic surgery provides benefits similar to laparoscopic surgery. These include smaller incisions, fewer scars and less bleeding. You may also experience less pain and a faster recovery time compared to an open surgery for a similar hernia.\nWhether you receive laparoscopic surgery or robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery depends on various factors \u2014 including whether the hospital has the technology, how skilled the surgeon is with the technology, and other specifics with the hernia itself (size, location, previous repairs, need for skin excision).\nSome types of hernias still require open surgery. Ask your healthcare provider which type of surgery they recommend for you. Discuss the benefits of robotic surgery with your surgeon over other types, and make sure you\u2019re comfortable with the final decision."

                    "body": "Robotic hernia repair surgery is unique in that it introduces a new key player into the operating room: robotics technology. The technology allows more precise movements and greater visualization so your surgeon can repair your hernia. But your surgeon (not a robot) is still in control during the procedure. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions about your treatment, including how using robotics may shape the experience. Your surgeon is your best resource for understanding how to prepare for surgery and what to expect afterward."

Your surgeon attaches the lower part of your tibia (shin bone) to the upper part of your femur (thigh bone) to bridge the gap left by the removed part. In this way, the lower tibia replaces the lower femur, and your rotated ankle replaces your knee joint.\nThis leaves you with a complete and functional upper leg. Then, you can attach a prosthesis (artificial limb) to your new knee joint. The prosthesis on the end, together with the functional knee, allows you to walk and run normally. When you sit down and stand up, your \u201cknees\u201d will be parallel and bend together. And when you wear pants, you might not be able to tell the difference between the two legs.",

                    "question": "Who is rotationplasty for?",
                    "body": "Rotationplasty is one option when you need surgery to remove part of your upper leg but want to preserve as much mobility and durability as possible. Bone cancer is the most common reason for this. Cancerous tumors that affect your leg bones, like osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma, are more common in children and teens than in adults. This is one reason why children have rotationplasty more often.\nCongenital (present at birth) defects are another, less common reason why children have rotationplasty. For example, congenital femoral deficiency (CFD) is an underdeveloped femur. When your entire femur is unusable, your entire tibia can substitute for it, with your knee joint replacing your hip joint. (CFD often appears with another condition called fibular hemimelia, which makes your shin shorter.)\nOther reasons for rotationplasty can affect children or adults, but these are rarer. They include:\n*Traumatic leg injuries.\n*Persistent leg infections.\n*Cancer that spreads to your leg from somewhere else.\nChildren make the best candidates for rotationplasty because their bones are still growing. As they grow, their reconstructed leg grows with them, so they can better adapt it to their activities. Adults don\u2019t have this advantage, but there are still cases where rotationplasty might be their best option.",

You\u2019ll need to prepare yourself mentally and emotionally for the road ahead.\n*Physical exam: Your healthcare provider will check to make sure your hip and ankle joints have a full range of motion. They\u2019ll also check that the main nerve in the leg, your sciatic nerve, still functions well. You\u2019ll need this nerve to be fully functional for the surgery to work.\n*Imaging exams: Your provider might order X-rays, an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or a CT scan (computed tomography scan) before scheduling your rotationplasty. These tests help your surgical team assess the overall condition of your leg, what they\u2019ll need to accomplish during surgery and how likely it is to succeed.\n*Prosthesis preparation: Your healthcare provider may make a mold of your foot before surgery. This helps them make a temporary leg prosthesis that you can wear soon after the procedure. The temporary prosthesis helps you recover until your long-term prosthesis is ready for you.",

Most people will have the lower part of their thigh, knee and the upper part of their shin removed, but this may look different from patient to patient. If you have rotationplasty for bone cancer, your surgeon will make sure to remove all of the tumor, along with a margin of healthy tissue around it.\n*Reattachment: Your surgeon reattaches the remaining part of your lower leg to the remaining part of your upper leg, including the bones, blood vessels if needed, muscles and skin. They rotate the lower part 180 degrees so that your heel faces toward your front and your toes face backward.\n*Stabilization: Your surgeon uses plates and screws or a rod to hold the two parts of your leg in place. This hardware helps connect your bones together as your leg heals. The two bones will eventually grow together to form a single bone.",

Your nerves and blood vessels stay intact, and the leg continues to grow as you grow, which is especially helpful for children.\nOther benefits include:\n*More durability. Using your own leg makes it easier to return to activities like running, jumping, and high-impact sports.

                    "body": "It may take three to six months for the bones in your leg to fully heal. If you receive chemotherapy for bone cancer after surgery, healing will take longer. You may need a wheelchair or crutches to move around during this time. Once your incision has healed and the swelling has gone down, you\u2019ll be able to start wearing a prosthesis. You\u2019ll learn to use this prosthesis as the lower part of your leg and foot.\nPhysical therapy is an important part of recovering from rotationplasty. A physical therapist will help you regain strength and flexibility in your hip and ankle joints. They\u2019ll also teach you how to begin using your ankle joint as your new knee joint. This takes practice: You\u2019ll have to retrain your brain and nerves to recognize your new knee and to work together with your prosthesis as your new lower leg.\nWhile adults may take longer than children to adjust to the new leg, most people are able to walk without aid after three to six months. Within six to 12 months, you should be able to return to any activity you wish, including high-impact sports. Many people are pleasantly surprised by how functional their leg is after rotationplasty. The working knee joint gives you mobility you wouldn\u2019t have otherwise.",

Cancer treatments like chemotherapy can sometimes interfere with the healing process. This risk is similar with rotationplasty and other limb salvage procedures. Most people recover well from rotationplasty, and they report long-term satisfaction with their results.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nMaking a choice like rotationplasty is difficult and might feel very lonely. You\u2019re unlikely to know anyone else who\u2019s faced that choice. But thanks to social media, people living with rotationplasty are much easier to find than they used to be. They\u2019re telling their stories, performing in sports and living their best lives on camera. Spending some time with them could help you get used to the idea of rotationplasty."

A surgeon may use existing genital tissue from the clitoris to create a penis (metoidioplasty). Or the procedure may take skin from another part of your body (phalloplasty) to form a penis. Gender-affirming surgery uses general anesthesia due to the complexity of the procedure.\nTo construct the scrotum, your surgeon will cut and shape the lower part of the labia majora into a scrotum-like sac. The labia majora are the large, fleshy lips that enclose and protect the vagina.\nAfter your scrotum heals, you may choose to get\u00a0testicular prostheses (implants) during another procedure.

                    "question": "Does insurance cover scrotoplasty?",
                    "body": "Most insurance providers, Medicare and Medicaid cover the cost of scrotoplasty to treat medical conditions like buried penis. They usually won\u2019t cover cosmetic surgeries like a scrotal lift.\nCoverage is more complex for people seeking gender affirmation surgery. Many insurance companies require you to submit specific documentation before they\u2019ll cover a gender-affirming surgery like health records that show consistent gender dysphoria.\nThe law requires most private health insurers to cover medically necessary transition-related care. Medicare and Medicaid also provide this coverage. But there can be exclusions, and scrotoplasty might be one of them. You should check with your insurance provider about coverage. You can learn more at the National Center for Transgender Equality.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nYou can have scrotoplasty to treat medical conditions or as part of gender affirmation. Both types of procedures are safe and successful most of the time. While there are risks to scrotoplasty, when surgery is warranted, the benefits of feeling confident after the procedure typically outweigh this. People getting gender affirmation procedures receive care from many healthcare providers. These include mental health counselors, urologists and plastic surgeons. Whatever the reason you\u2019re seeking scrotoplasty, your healthcare team is here to answer your questions.",

                    "body": "Self-catheterization is a way to empty your bladder when you have difficulty peeing. As the name suggests, you perform the procedure yourself.\nSelf-catheterization, also called clean intermittent catheterization (CIC) or intermittent self-catheterization (ISC), involves inserting a thin, hollow tube into your bladder through your urethra. Urine (pee) drains out of the catheter into a toilet or collection container. When your bladder is empty, you slip out (remove) the catheter. You repeat these steps at regular intervals several times a day (typically every four to six hours).\nYour healthcare provider will teach you how to use a catheter the right way. There are different sizes and types of catheters. The one you use depends on your needs. Other supplies like lubricants and antiseptic towelettes are usually necessary to make the process easier. It\u2019s important to always use clean hands when placing your catheter to avoid infection.",

An important part of your lymphatic system (which makes up your immune system), your spleen makes white blood cells that help fight infections. It also filters old and damaged blood cells.\nAn injury or disease that prevents your spleen from performing these functions may pose a threat to your health. In that case, you may need a splenectomy.\nYou can live without a spleen. In its absence, your liver and bone marrow take over most of your spleen\u2019s functions. Still, your spleen is an important infection-fighter. Without it, you\u2019ll need to take extra precautions, like getting regular vaccines, to prevent infections.",

                            "body": "The most common reasons for a splenectomy include trauma (injury) to your spleen and treatment for a blood disorder.\nConditions that may require a splenectomy include:\n*Ruptured spleen: Trauma to your spleen can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. For example, a direct hit to your upper left abdomen during a car accident or contact sport can rupture your spleen.\n*Blood disorders: You may need a splenectomy to treat certain blood disorders if other medical treatments haven\u2019t worked. These disorders include idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, polycythemia vera, thalassemia, hereditary spherocytosis, sickle cell anemia and autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\n*Certain cancers: You may need a splenectomy if you have lymphoma (Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and an enlarged spleen is causing pain or a low blood cell count. A splenectomy is a routine part of cancer surgery for pancreatic cancer that starts in the part of your pancreas closest to your spleen. You may also need a splenectomy to treat less common cancers, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia and hairy cell leukemia. In rare situations, you may need a splenectomy if cancer that starts elsewhere in your body spreads to your spleen (metastatic cancer).\n*Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly): Your provider may remove your spleen to determine the cause of an enlarged spleen or to treat splenomegaly symptoms such as abdominal pain.\n*Hypersplenism: You may need a splenectomy if your spleen becomes so active (\u201chyper\u201d) that it destroys too many blood cells and platelets.\n*Infection: Although it\u2019s rare, you may need a splenectomy to remove an abscess in your spleen. An abscess is a pocket of pus caused by an infection.\n*Benign growths. You may need a splenectomy to remove large cysts and noncancerous tumors. But this is rare.",

You\u2019ll usually start getting shots 10 to 12 weeks before surgery so you\u2019re fully vaccinated at least two weeks before surgery. This timeline optimizes your body\u2019s immune response, so you\u2019re protected from infection once your spleen\u2019s gone. If you don\u2019t get vaccinated before surgery, then you\u2019ll need vaccination two weeks after the surgery.\n*Quitting smoking. Your body can\u2019t heal itself as quickly if you smoke or use tobacco products. If you smoke, your provider will work with you on quitting.\n*A physical exam, blood tests and imaging. Your healthcare provider will examine you and order blood tests to ensure you\u2019re in good shape for surgery. They may order imaging to help plan for surgery.\nFollow your provider\u2019s guidance on if you need to fast or stop taking certain medicines, like blood thinners, before surgery.",

                    "body": "Once you\u2019re able to tolerate a regular diet, move around without difficulty and your pain is under control, you\u2019ll be discharged home. This usually occurs within two to three days with the laparoscopic technique and five to seven days with an open incision.\nBefore you\u2019re discharged, your care team will ensure you understand how to navigate life without a spleen. This includes:\n*Getting regular vaccinations. You\u2019ll need to stay up to date on vaccines to prevent viral and bacterial infections.\n*Understanding what antibiotics you\u2019ll need. You may need to take antibiotics daily if you belong to a high-risk group. People more likely to develop life-threatening infections include children under 5 and people who are immunocompromised. Regardless of your risk factors, you\u2019ll need emergency antibiotics you can take in case you experience symptoms of an infection.\n*Knowing when to visit the ER. You should know the symptoms of an infection (like fever, vomiting, chills) so you can get to an ER (emergency room) immediately if they start.\n*Understanding travel precautions. You should understand the risks associated with traveling. For example, traveling to areas with high instances of malaria or babesiosis can be especially risky without a spleen. Schedule a visit with your healthcare provider 12 weeks before traveling to discuss precautions and get any needed shots.\n*Having a medical ID on you. You should carry a card or wear a medical ID bracelet so that all providers and potential caregivers know you don\u2019t have a spleen.",

Your team will ask if you have any implanted devices for heart or cancer treatment, allergies to intravenous contrast material or iodine and if you have claustrophobia.\n*Explain the process: There\u2019s a lot that goes into this treatment. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask questions, particularly if anything about treatment makes you feel anxious.\n*Do imaging tests: Tests may include computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to pinpoint tumor location. People with brain tumors or brain issues will have brain MRIs.\n*Do treatment planning: This may include simulating treatment, which is like doing a practice run before the actual treatment.\n*Establish dosage: Your team will determine if you\u2019ll get a single high dose of radiation or smaller doses over several treatment sessions. They may call this fractionated treatment or stereotactic radiotherapy.\n*Prepare immobilization devices: You\u2019ll need to stay very still during stereotactic radiosurgery so that radiation hits the tumor and not healthy tissue. Immobilization devices help with that. For example, if you\u2019re having brain cancer treatment, your team will fit you with a head frame.",

The table will slide into the unit, where your treatment will begin. But if you\u2019re having stereotactic body radiation therapy, radiation streams from the arm of a machine.\nIn general, you can expect your team to:\n*Review what you can expect during treatment.\n*Help you up on the treatment table, the same table used for simulation.\n*Put immobilization devices in place. Again, immobilization helps you to stay very still during treatment, so radiation focuses on the tumor and not on healthy tissue.\n*Demonstrate the intercom system you\u2019ll use if you want to talk to the team once they leave the treatment room.\n*Remind you that you won\u2019t feel anything during treatment, but you may hear machinery moving into place.",

Chronic inflammation due to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), like Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis, can lead to strictures. Strictures typically form on the lower part of your small intestine (ileum) and the valve between your large and small intestines (ileocecal valve). But they can also develop in your large intestine (colon), rectum or anus (butthole).\nStrictureplasty can help relieve uncomfortable or painful digestive tract symptoms. It can also reduce your risk of an intestinal blockage and improve your quality of life. But strictureplasty does carry a risk of complications like bleeding, infection and intestinal leakage. So, it\u2019s important to talk to your healthcare provider to weigh the benefits against the risks.",

                    "body": "A strictureplasty is a procedure that attempts to preserve the full length of your intestines by widening the strictures. A bowel resection removes the part of your intestine that has strictures.\nHealthcare providers prefer to use a strictureplasty first because it\u2019s less likely to cause a condition called short bowel syndrome. Short bowel syndrome can block your intestines\u2019 ability to absorb fluids and nutrients (malabsorption). This can result in serious malnourishment.\nAccording to one study, the risk of developing short bowel syndrome is lower with strictureplasty than with bowel resection. But people who get bowel resection are less likely to need additional bowel surgery in the future.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nIf you have IBD, you know the pain and discomfort that go along with it. If medication and other treatment options haven\u2019t helped, a strictureplasty may relieve the uncomfortable symptoms by widening any strictures in your bowels. Your healthcare provider will probably recommend a strictureplasty before a bowel resection. It\u2019s still a major surgery, but it spares the length of your colon. Before the procedure, talk to your provider about any concerns you have.",

        "Introduction": "Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is a form of allergy treatment, usually for dust mites and seasonal allergies. These allergies can cause symptoms like a runny nose, sneezing and itchy eyes. SLIT comes in tablets or drops that contain a small amount of the allergen. You take a dose every day by dissolving it under your tongue.",

                    "question": "What is this sublingual immunotherapy?",
                    "body": "Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is an allergy treatment that works by dissolving tablets or liquid under your tongue every day. It exposes you to small amounts of your allergen in a controlled way until you don\u2019t have an allergic reaction to it anymore (or you have fewer symptoms of an allergic reaction).\nWhen the tablet or liquid dissolves under your tongue, the allergen enters your bloodstream through mucous membranes in your mouth. Once in your blood, special immune cells (T-cells) recognize it. Over time, instead of triggering an immune reaction, the T-cells send signals to your immune system that calm it down. With regular treatment, this helps prevent you from getting symptoms like sneezing, itchy eyes and a runny nose.\nHealthcare providers most commonly use SLIT to treat people who have allergic reactions to pollen and other airborne particles (\u201chay fever\u201d or allergic rhinitis). This might include grasses, weeds and dust mites. But they\u2019re also starting to use it to treat food allergies, like peanuts.",

There, they can monitor you for reactions and show you how to take SLIT at home. Your provider will give you tablets (or liquid) to use at home and instructions on how to use them. They\u2019ll also prescribe a self-injectable epinephrine device (like Epipen\u00ae or Auvi-Q\u00ae) in case you have an allergic reaction (this is rare).\nFor some allergens, you might have a period of dose escalation, or updosing. This means you get a little more allergen per dose over time (a few weeks to a few months) until you reach full strength. You might have to go to your provider\u2019s office for each dose escalation.\nYou\u2019ll have to take SLIT at home every day. Follow your provider\u2019s instructions exactly. An example of how they might direct you to take your dose might be:\n*Put the tablet or a specific number of drops under your tongue. Let the tablet dissolve.\n*Wait one to two minutes before swallowing.\n*Wait five to 15 minutes (sometimes longer) before eating or drinking.",

Healthcare providers sometimes call it subtalar arthrodesis.\nA joint is any place in your body where two bones meet. The subtalar joint connects two bones in your foot. It\u2019s where your ankle bone (talus) meets your heel bone (calcaneus). You have one subtalar joint in each foot. They\u2019re just below your ankle joint. Your subtalar joints help you move and keep your balance by letting your foot tilt in toward and out away from the center of your body.\nSurgeons most commonly use subtalar fusion to treat severe foot arthritis. Your bones will rub against each other if arthritis has worn away the cartilage that cushions and lubricates your subtalar joint. This can damage your joint and become extremely painful over time. Your surgeon will fuse the bones in your subtalar joint together to become one bone. This fusion will reduce the extra friction inside your foot and relieve the pain.\nA healthcare provider will usually suggest subtalar fusion after other, nonsurgical treatments haven\u2019t worked for you. Fusion can relieve severe pain, stiffness and other symptoms that make it hard to move and use your foot.",

It can be scary to consider surgery that permanently changes a joint in your foot, but don\u2019t downplay your experiences. Tell your providers if foot pain or other symptoms are bad enough to make you avoid certain activities or types of movement, or if they make day-to-day activities hard.\nBefore your surgery date you\u2019ll need:\n*A physical exam to make sure you\u2019re healthy enough for surgery.\n*Imaging tests, including a foot X-ray. You might also need an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT scan (computed tomography scan).\n*Blood tests.\nShare all the medications and over-the-counter (OTC) or herbal supplements you take with your provider and surgeon. You may need to stop taking certain medications or supplements before your surgery.\nYour surgeon will tell you when to fast the day before your surgery. Typically, people need to avoid eating and drinking for 12 hours before subtalar fusion surgery.",

An anesthesiologist will give you either general anesthesia to put you to sleep and/or a regional anesthesia to numb your foot and ankle.\nDuring a subtalar fusion, your surgeon will permanently join the bones in your subtalar joint together.\nMost subtalar fusions are open surgeries. That means your surgeon will make incisions (cuts) in your skin to operate on your foot joint. If you have an open subtalar fusion your surgeon will:\n*Make incisions in the skin around your subtalar joint.\n*Remove any damaged cartilage and bone.\n*Insert screws through the bones in your subtalar joint to join them together.\n*Secure the screws in place, then close the incisions.\nSome people have ankle fusions done via an arthroscopy. This is a minimally invasive technique. Your surgeon will make smaller incisions in your foot than an open surgery. Then, they\u2019ll insert a special tool called an arthroscope into your subtalar joint. The arthroscope includes a camera and a light that lets your surgeon see what\u2019s going on inside your foot.\nThe steps will be the same. It just depends on which surgery technique is right for you.",

Nonunion happens when the bones in your foot don\u2019t fuse together like they should. If your bones don\u2019t heal into one bone after your surgery, you might need another operation.\nLike any surgery, subtalar fusion has some risks, including:\n*Reactions to anesthesia.\n*Infections.\n*Pain.\n*Bleeding.\nHaving a subtalar fusion can permanently reduce the range of motion in your foot (how far you can move it). Because two bones have been joined to become one, you might not be able to rotate your foot as much or as smoothly after surgery. Even if it\u2019s relatively common to lose some range of motion, the benefits outweigh the risks for most people who have severe foot pain. You might not be able to move your foot side-to-side as much, but you should experience significantly less pain."

Whether or not you can point to your subtalar joint on an anatomical diagram, you might be a good candidate for a subtalar fusion if you have severe foot pain that doesn\u2019t get better after trying several nonsurgical treatments.\nJoint fusion permanently joins two bones together so they heal to become one. This can affect how far you can move your subtalar joint. You might not be able to tilt or move your foot as far from side to side after surgery. But for most people, it\u2019s worth it so they can live with significantly less (or no) pain. Talk to your surgeon or healthcare provider. They\u2019ll help you understand why subtalar fusion might be a good option to help you get back on your feet and enjoy your favorite activities again.",

                    "body": "Fundoplication reinforces your gastroesophageal junction (GEJ), the junction where the end of your esophagus meets the top of your stomach. If you have chronic acid reflux (GERD), it\u2019s because this junction has become too relaxed, allowing stomach acid to flow backward into your esophagus.\nOften, a hiatal hernia is also involved in GERD. This means that the top of your stomach (fundus) is emerging through the esophageal hiatus. That's the opening in your diaphragm that your esophagus passes through to meet your stomach below it. A TIF procedure can also correct a hiatal hernia.",

It offers a third choice between surgery and lifelong medication with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which is the usual treatment for GERD.\nSome people with GERD find that PPIs become less effective in managing their symptoms over time. This may be because their GEJ continues to weaken. Others have concerns about taking PPIs long-term for various reasons.

An esophagram takes video X-rays (fluoroscopy) of your esophagus swallowing.\n*Upper endoscopy. This exam involves looking inside your esophagus with an endoscope.\n*Esophageal pH test. This test measures the acid content inside your esophagus through a small wireless receiver. Your provider places the receiver in your esophagus during an endoscopy.\n*Esophageal manometry. This test measures muscle activity in your esophagus, using pressure sensors embedded in a nasogastric tube. It can confirm if your muscles aren\u2019t working right.\nThe TIF procedure might not be the right treatment for you if you have:\n*A large hiatal hernia.\n*A swallowing disorder.\n*Severe erosive esophagitis.\n*Permanent tissue changes, like Barrett\u2019s esophagus or esophageal stricture.",

                    "body": "Nissen fundoplication is the original surgical procedure to treat acid reflux and hiatal hernia. The main difference is that a surgeon accesses your gastroesophageal junction through an incision in your abdomen. Or it may be several small incisions, if you\u2019re having minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery.\nAnother difference is that the Nissen technique traditionally makes a tighter fold around your esophagus than the TIF procedure. This strong reinforcement has made the procedure very effective in treating GERD and hiatal hernias, especially when they\u2019re severe. But for some people, it\u2019s too tight.\nReported complications after Nissen fundoplication include difficulties with swallowing, burping and vomiting. This happens when the fundoplication is too tight. The TIF procedure isn\u2019t associated with these types of long-term side effects. You can still burp and swallow normally after the TIF procedure.\nOverall, the TIF procedure offers a more moderate type of correction for a more moderate type of problem. If your hiatal hernia isn\u2019t too big and your acid reflux isn\u2019t too severe, you can benefit from the TIF procedure without risking overcorrecting. You can also avoid surgery and its longer recovery time.",

This procedure can\u2019t undo vision loss after it happens, but it can prevent vision loss from getting worse.\nInside your eye, between the cornea and the lens, is a fluid called aqueous humor. That fluid is supposed to help your eye hold its shape. It also circulates and drains as new fluid replaces it.\nBut when you have glaucoma, too much pressure inside your eye damages the optic nerve at the back of your eye.

                    "body": "During a trabeculectomy, your eye surgeon will have you lay on your back on an operating table. They usually insert an intravenous (IV) line if they have to give you certain medications, but that isn\u2019t always necessary.\nBefore the actual procedure starts, they\u2019ll also place a small, clip-like device that holds your eyelids open. They\u2019ll also numb the eye and may supplement topical anesthetic with a nerve block. Usually, local anesthesia is all this procedure requires, but some people may need general anesthesia for specific reasons. The difference between these anesthesia types works like so:\n*If you\u2019re receiving local anesthesia (with or without a nerve block), you\u2019ll be awake for the procedure. Your eye will be numb so you won\u2019t have any pain during the surgery. You might feel some movement or pressure, but it shouldn\u2019t hurt. If you\u2019re worried about anxiety during the procedure, tell your eye surgeon during your pre-surgery visits. They can talk to you about options to prevent or limit that.\n*If you receive general anesthesia, you\u2019ll be asleep for the procedure. That keeps you from feeling any pain during the surgery.\nDuring the procedure, your eye surgeon will make a small flap or opening on your eye surface. They\u2019ll then make a very tiny opening and route for aqueous humor fluid to pass through. That will leave a small bump on your eye surface called a \u201cbleb\u201d under your upper eyelid. Your body can reabsorb the fluid from there.\nDepending on your specific case and needs, your surgeon may inject certain medications to keep scar tissue from forming and blocking the opening. They\u2019ll then place sutures that they can remove later, if necessary, to lower pressure in your eye further.\nOnce your surgeon finishes the surgery, they\u2019ll cover it with a bandage or patch (dressing) so your eye can heal. They\u2019ll also give you an eye shield \u2014 a firm, wearable item to keep anything from touching your eye. They\u2019ll monitor you for a short time after your surgery (the amount of time varies, mainly depending on the type of anesthesia used). After that, you can go home.",

Some of them include:\n*The first night after your surgery: You\u2019ll continue wearing the bandage or patch overnight. Your provider may have you wear your eye shield every time you sleep for at least a month after surgery. You\u2019ll also need to put medicated eye drops in the affected eye multiple times a day. Your eye surgeon will tell you how often and for how long.\n*The day after your surgery: Your eye care specialist will schedule a follow-up appointment the day after your surgery to remove the bandage/patch covering your eye. That follow-up visit is an important part of making sure this surgery works correctly and preventing complications.\n*One week after your surgery: Your eye care specialist will likely schedule another follow-up visit a week after your surgery. That will let them monitor and track your recovery. After this visit, you should expect to see them for follow-up visits every one to two weeks for at least two months. Depending on how your eye is healing, you may need to see your provider more frequently.\nYour eye specialist will monitor your eye pressure as part of your follow-up visits, which is part of why it\u2019s so important to go to those visits. If your eye pressure is still too high, they may use a special laser to release some of the sutures, helping lower your eye pressure further."

                    "body": "If trabeculectomy isn\u2019t able to lower your eye pressure to prevent further damage from glaucoma, there are still treatment options. The first treatment option is placing drainage tubes in your eye so aqueous humor fluid can drain.\nIf that doesn\u2019t help or isn\u2019t an option, your provider may recommend a cyclodestructive procedure. These intentionally damage parts of the ciliary body (that\u2019s the part of your eye that makes aqueous humor fluid). There are many ways to do this, but they usually involve using a laser.\nOne downside to cyclodestructive procedures is that your ciliary body regenerates. That means you\u2019ll probably need multiple treatments to get the effect you need.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nIt\u2019s easy to take your sense of vision for granted when it works correctly. But if you face the possibility of vision loss and blindness, that can be a source of anxiety, fear or even anger. Trabeculectomy is important because it offers hope when first-line glaucoma treatments like medications and laser procedures aren\u2019t helpful. An eye care specialist like an ophthalmologist can tell you more about this procedure and whether it\u2019s likely to help you.",

        "Introduction": "Transoral robotic surgery (TORS) uses sophisticated technology to access hard-to-reach areas in the back of the throat. Operating from a console, your surgeon controls robotic instruments that remove head and neck tumors seamlessly. Surgeons also use TORS to treat obstructive sleep apnea and lingual tonsillitis.",

                    "question": "What is transoral robotic surgery (TORS)?",
                    "body": "During transoral robotic surgery (TORS), a surgeon uses robotic instruments within a single port and a computer surgeon console to operate on hard-to-reach areas in the back of your throat, all through your mouth. It\u2019s a minimally invasive surgery that removes head and neck cancers that would be hard to access otherwise.\nThe technology for the standard robot, the da Vinci\u00ae Surgical System, includes:\n*A surgeon console: Surgeons use the console to control robotic instruments within a single port in your mouth.\n*A single port: Your surgeon inserts a camera and three instruments through a single port, giving them access to the back of your throat through your mouth.\n*A camera: The camera provides three-dimensional (3D) views of the back of your throat.\n*Three robotic surgical instruments: Imagine the instruments as steady extensions of your surgeon\u2019s hands. The instruments make the movements, but your surgeon is the operator. These instruments are multi-jointed and can bend and flex in many directions.\nBefore TORS, a surgeon would have to split your lower jawbone (a procedure called a mandibulotomy) to reach tumors far back in your mouth. Mandibulotomy is a time-intensive surgery (up to 12 hours) with a long recovery period.\nTORS allows surgeons to remove tumors far back in your mouth and throat without having to make open cuts to access them. The surgery time and recovery period are significantly shorter, too.",

                    "body": "Depending on the type of cancer, surgical removal may be your best option for curing your cancer or for managing symptoms. TORS provides several benefits compared to traditional open surgery, including:\n*Greater precision: The robotic instruments move more steadily and with a greater range of motion to areas that are difficult to access. They allow your surgeon to operate with more precision and control.\n*Shorter operating times: An experienced surgeon can complete the procedure in less than two hours (compared to up to 12 hours for mandibulotomy).\n*Easier recovery: Most people only stay in the hospital for a few days following surgery (as opposed to up to 15 days for mandibulotomy). Most people experience less pain after surgery and a quicker return to daily activities. You\u2019re also less likely to have visible scars following TORS.\n*Decreased likelihood of additional procedures: You\u2019re less likely to need a tracheostomy (procedure to insert a breathing tube) during surgery or extensive reconstructive surgery afterward.\n*Reduced risk of complications: You\u2019re less likely to have severe blood loss or long-term speaking or swallowing issues than with open surgery.\n*Potential to reduce or eliminate the need for radiation or chemotherapy: Removing the tumor entirely also reduces the likelihood you\u2019ll need additional treatments, like radiation therapy or chemotherapy, to ensure all the cancer is gone. Or, a successful surgery can reduce the number of radiation or chemo treatments you\u2019ll need going forward.",

During the procedure, they\u2019ll use a special light that illuminates the dye so they can see the tumor.\nTo perform TURBT, your surgeon will:\n*Insert the scope into your bladder through your urethra.\n*Locate and remove the tumor with a small cutting device. A pathology lab will examine it after the procedure.\n*Apply heat to stop any bleeding from where they resected the tumor.\n*Remove the scope and insert a catheter (if needed).

Both methods involve using a piece of your intestines to divert urine.\n*Incontinent: An incontinent urinary diversion involves creating an opening in your abdomen for pee to come out of. Surgeons do this by connecting your ureters to a piece of your intestine that they bring out through your belly (ostomy or stoma). Pee collects into a bag called an ostomy bag, which you empty. This is sometimes called an incontinent diversion or urostomy.\n*Continent: A continent urinary diversion involves making a pouch inside your body from your intestines. This might be in the form of a \u201cneobladder\u201d that connects to your urethra, or with an Indiana pouch that collects urine inside your body that you drain by passing a catheter into a stoma at your belly button.\nWithin each type of urinary diversion are several different methods your surgeon can use.

A portion of your small intestine is made into a new bladder, which your surgeons connect to your urethra. Pee passes from your kidneys to your ureters and into the pouch (new bladder), and through your urethra, just like it would with a typical bladder. To empty the neobladder, you need to contract (tighten) your abdominal muscles.\nTo be a candidate for this surgery, there must be a low risk of cancer recurrence (return) in your urethra, and you can\u2019t have any scar tissue or blockage of your urethra Additionally, some people can\u2019t empty the neobladder by contracting their abdominals. In these cases, they must pass a catheter into the urethra to empty the pouch up to six times a day.\nThe advantages of the neobladder diversion are:\n*The process of urination most closely matches normal urination.\n*There\u2019s no stoma to care for.\nThe disadvantages of the neobladder diversion are:\n*Surgery time is usually longer.\n*Urinary incontinence (leaking pee) is normal after surgery and might last up to six months. About 20% of people with this type of diversion have incontinence during the night. Up to 10% of people have incontinence during the day and must wear pads to catch leaking pee.\n*Some people may never be able to fully empty their new bladders and will still need to perform catheterization (either temporarily or permanently).",

                    "body": "After urinary reconstruction and diversion, it takes one to two months to feel well again and to regain your strength. The goal is to get you back to your lifestyle as soon as possible. It may take you several weeks to get used to your new way of urinating. Ask your healthcare provider any questions you have about caring for your stoma and ostomy bag or draining your pouch with a catheter. They\u2019ll make sure you have all the instructions you need to take care of yourself when you leave the hospital.\nPeople with urinary diversions are usually able to return to the lives, work and hobbies they enjoy:\n*Work: Most people can return to their jobs in one or two months, on average. If you have concerns about your line of work or other job hazards, be sure to ask your healthcare provider.\n*Activities:\u00a0You should be able to go back to exercising or participating in sports as soon as you recover. Your healthcare provider will let you know when you can resume your normal activity level after surgery and if you should avoid contact sports or swimming. Ask your surgeon about any temporary restrictions on lifting objects.\n*Eating plan: Your surgeon may recommend soft foods that are easy to digest for a month after surgery. If you have food-related questions, ask your provider.\n*Travel:\u00a0There are no travel restrictions. But, you should travel with any supplies you need or have emergency supplies (like extra ostomy bags, for example) available.\nUrinary diversion surgery can affect you emotionally as well as physically. You may feel anxious about resuming sexual intimacy or feel scared that your relationship with your partner may change after surgery. It\u2019s important to talk with your provider about your concerns to see if medication, sex therapy or other support groups can help you.",

Things to look for include skin irritation like swelling or redness or leaking pus or pee.\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nAs with any life change, an adjustment period is normal after a major surgery like urinary diversion. It\u2019s not unusual to feel discouraged or worried about how your life has changed or what you need to do differently after surgery. The good news is most people go back to their usual activities within two months of surgery. Because a major change was made to how you pee, there\u2019s going to be a learning curve. Be patient with yourself. If your urinary diversion procedure makes you feel self-conscious, talk to your healthcare provider about support groups or other resources available to help you cope.\n",

Cosmetic means how something looks or makes you feel. There are many reasons why a person may decide to pursue vaginoplasty.

This can cause uncomfortable symptoms and affect sexual function.\n*Medical conditions: People may need vaginal reconstruction after undergoing radiation to treat cancer. A vaginoplasty can also help reshape your vagina if your provider removes it during cancer treatment.\n*Congenital conditions: Certain congenital abnormalities (conditions present at birth) can affect how your vagina looks and functions. This could include being born without a vagina or being unable to menstruate due to an underdeveloped vagina.\n*Gender affirmation: People may have vaginoplasty as part of\u00a0feminizing bottom surgery.",

Your surgeon will assess your situation to see whether a shunt or a ventriculostomy is best for you."

                    "body": "Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are procedures to treat compression fractures in your spine. During kyphoplasty, a surgeon will use a needle to inflate a small balloon which opens up space for the cement to fill in the fracture. The balloon isn\u2019t part of vertebroplasty, but a surgeon will inject the same cement to repair the fracture during this procedure. Kyphoplasty is more common than vertebroplasty. \nA note from Cleveland Clinic\nVertebroplasty is a safe procedure to treat compression fractures. It has a good success rate in relieving pain. You might feel pain relief immediately, or it could take a few days before you feel better. While side effects are possible, the risk is low. If you have any questions about the procedure, talk to your surgeon or healthcare provider. They\u2019re available to answer any questions you have before and after treatment."

        "Introduction": "A vesicostomy is a procedure to empty a child\u2019s or infant\u2019s bladder. It involves a surgeon making a small cut into their abdomen to drain their pee. The procedure is usually a temporary fix until the child gets treatment for the underlying reason they can\u2019t empty their bladder.",

                    "body": "A vesicostomy is a procedure to allow pee (urine) to drain from a child\u2019s bladder when they have trouble emptying their bladder on their own.\nIt involves a surgeon making a small opening in a child\u2019s abdomen (usually just below their belly button). The goal of a vesicostomy is to prevent pee from backing up into a child\u2019s kidneys and urinary tract, where it can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) and kidney damage. The pee drains directly into your child\u2019s diaper instead of draining into a colostomy bag.\nThe procedure is a temporary fix while your child\u2019s healthcare provider determines how to treat the underlying reason your child can\u2019t empty their bladder. They can let you know how long your child may need to pee in this way.\nYour child\u2019s surgeon performs a vesicostomy in an operating room while they\u2019re asleep (under general anesthesia). It may involve spending one night in the hospital.",

Rest assured that a vesicostomy is a safe and effective procedure that removes pee from their bladder so it doesn\u2019t back up into their kidneys and cause damage. Talk to your child\u2019s surgeon so you understand the procedure and how you can help care for them afterward. Caring for a child after this procedure involves keeping the area clean and dry and inserting a catheter to stretch the opening so it continues to allow pee to empty."

This medicine puts you to sleep so you don\u2019t feel pain during surgery.\nThere are different approaches to voice feminization surgery, including:\n*Anterior glottal web formation (Wendler glottoplasty): Removes several layers of tissue from the vocal cords at the front of your voice box. Your laryngologist uses stitches to join the vocal cords in this area, shortening the overall length of your voice box. This is the most common type of voice feminization surgery.\n*Laser reduction glottoplasty (LRG): Destroys the outermost tissues of your vocal cords with light energy from a laser, increasing the tension in your vocal cords. It\u2019s a type of laser-assisted voice adjustment (LAVA).\n*Cricothyroid approximation (CTA): Stitches together cartilage from the top and bottom of your voice box, increasing the tightness of your vocal cords. This was the first procedure for voice feminization surgery. Laryngologists use it less and less because studies show its effects aren\u2019t as long-lasting as other types of surgery.\n*Feminization laryngoplasty: Removes cartilage from your thyroid (a gland in your neck) and parts of your vocal cords.

It\u2019s less likely your voice will drop when you\u2019re making an involuntary sound, like coughing or clearing your throat. You can rely on your pitch remaining constant when your voice tires. Additionally, surgery requires no conscious effort on your part to maintain these effects.\n*Prevent you from getting misgendered based on pitch alone. It\u2019s less likely you\u2019ll get misgendered in situations where people assume gender based only on how high or low your voice is, like over the phone.",

The final results will depend on how high or low your pitch is before surgery.\nStill, success depends on your treatment goals. How high or low someone\u2019s voice is only accounts for about 40% of how we perceive gender based on speech and communication. The other 60% comes from things you learn in voice therapy, like loudness, resonance, pitch variation and nonverbal cues.\nThis is why it\u2019s so important to talk with your laryngologist and SLP before surgery so everyone\u2019s on the same page about what a successful voice transition means for you."

                    "body": "Voice masculinization surgery (thyroplasty type III) permanently deepens your voice. It\u2019s a type of gender-affirmation surgery that changes your vocal cords to lower your pitch, or how low your voice sounds.\nVoice qualities, including pitch, contribute to information about gender identity. During puberty, people assigned male at birth (AMAB) experience an increase in testosterone that thickens their vocal cords and enlarges their voice box (larynx). This produces a lower pitch (deeper voice) than in people assigned female at birth (AFAB). If you\u2019re a transgender (trans) man or transmasculine person, having a higher voice may make you feel as if there\u2019s a mismatch between your gender and how you sound (gender incongruence).\nTaking testosterone as a part of masculinizing hormone therapy causes your voice to naturally deepen as it does for people AMAB during puberty. But if hormones alone don\u2019t lower your pitch enough, surgery may help.",

                    "body": "The main procedure for voice masculinization surgery is thyroplasty type III. Your surgeon will:\n*Administer anesthesia. You may get general anesthesia, which puts you to sleep. Or, you may get local anesthesia that numbs the area. With local anesthesia, your surgeon may ask you to speak during the operation so they can gauge changes in your voice. Either way, you won\u2019t feel pain during the procedure.\n*Make an incision. They\u2019ll make a tiny horizontal incision above your voice box so that they can access your vocal cords. Whenever possible, they\u2019ll cut into an already-existing neck fold to minimize scarring.\n*Remove tissue. They\u2019ll remove 1 to 3 millimeters (mm) of the thyroid cartilage housing your vocal cords. Your thyroid cartilage supports your voice box and sits just above your thyroid gland. Your surgeon will suture the remaining edges of the thyroid cartilage together to ensure stability. Removing some of the tissue loosens your vocal cords, which lowers your pitch.\n*Suture the wound. You\u2019ll need sutures to seal the area.\nVoice-deepening surgery should only take about an hour or two.",

On average, surgery reduces pitch by about 50 to 60 hertz (Hz).\nFor reference, pitches greater than 160 Hz are perceived as feminine, while pitches between 95 to 175 Hz are perceived as masculine. Pitches between 160 to 180 Hz may be perceived by others as gender neutral or gender ambiguous. Depending on your pitch before surgery, your voice may fall within a range that others more quickly perceive as masculine.\nIt\u2019s important to remember, though, that there are many other elements to communication, like resonance, speech rate and inflection, which also aid in being perceived as male by listeners.",

Some come in liquid form that may go down more easily while your voice box heals. You can also apply ice packs to the wound to numb the pain and keep the swelling down. Make sure you wrap ice packs in a dish cloth or towel before applying them to your skin.\n*Engaging in activities: You may need to wait a few weeks before you become active again. It may take a month or more before strenuous activities, like weightlifting or contact sports, are safe.\nIt\u2019s a good idea to work with a speech-language pathologist during and after recovery. They can help you care for your voice as you heal. They can teach you how to make the most of your new instrument so that you feel as confident as possible that your voice sounds right for you.",

The itching lets you know that your wound is healing.\n*Spraying or dribbling when you pee.\u00a0This should get better in time, as your wounds heal.\n*Electrical sensations at the surgery site. This is just your nerve endings healing.\n*Bruising in your genital area, your belly and thighs. The bruises may take up to a month to fade.\n*Swollen labia. It may take up to six months for the swelling to go down.\n*Scars that may be red, dark pink or purple.\u00a0These may take up to a year to disappear.\n*Numbness in your genitals. The numbness usually gets better within the next few months, but it can take up to 18 months to regain full sensation.\nYou\u2019ll have physical limitations during your recovery for at least six weeks or longer. This could include avoiding sexual intercourse, exercise, walking up and down the steps, driving and more. Be sure to follow your provider\u2019s recommendations on these and other restrictions.\nIn addition to following any after-care instructions that your provider shares with you, plan to attend regular checkups so that your healthcare provider can ensure you\u2019re healing as you should be.",

        "Introduction": "Secondary cataracts are the most common complication after cataract surgery, and YAG laser capsulotomy is a fast, safe and effective treatment.

Also known as secondary cataracts, PCO is when your vision is getting cloudy again after a previous cataract surgery.\nYAG stands for yttrium aluminum garnet, an artificial gemstone that\u2019s a key part of how the laser works. The laser fires precise pulses of energy that slice through the posterior capsule but shouldn\u2019t significantly disrupt other tissues at the front or back of your eye. The cuts let the capsule surface open up slightly so light can pass through without the cloudy capsule surface in the way.",

Your eye specialist will schedule you to come to their office for this outpatient procedure. Right before your surgery, your eye specialist will also give you eye drops to numb your eyes and dilate your pupils.

                    "body": "At the start of your YAG laser capsulotomy, your eye specialist will have you sit in a chair and position the laser in front of you. They\u2019ll tell you to keep your eyes on a single point ahead of you.\n*Laser programming. Your eye specialist will set up the laser so it fires in a set pattern.\n*Lens use (optional). Some eye specialists will also use a special lens that they\u2019ll hold against the surface of your eye. The lens will have some kind of lubricating gel or liquid on it, so there won\u2019t be any friction between the lens and your eye surface. Your eye will also be numb at this point, so the lens touching your eye won\u2019t cause any pain or discomfort. You may notice some pressure from the touch of the lens, but nothing more. If your eye specialist is holding that special lens to your eye, the laser beam will pass through it on the way to your eye.\n*Laser activation. Once your eye specialist is ready, they\u2019ll activate the laser, which sends out invisible pulses of energy. The laser\u2019s frequency is too high for you to see. You also won\u2019t feel anything in your eye, but you may hear a sound from the laser. When the laser is firing, you may notice some strange color changes in your vision, but these are normal and should stop after a few minutes.\nThe above steps take less than 10 minutes. Once your provider finishes using the laser, the procedure is over and you can go home."

Your eye is numb so you won\u2019t feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure itself. Afterward, the most you should expect is minor discomfort or soreness. If you do have pain, that\u2019s something you should tell your eye specialist about as soon as possible.\n*It\u2019s much less invasive than other approaches. Eye surgery is the only other way to do a posterior capsulotomy, and that approach is much more invasive. Using a laser to do posterior capsulotomy accomplishes the same goal without having to actually operate on your eyeball.",

This process is when your team makes sure everything is ready for your first treatment.\nPart of the simulation process uses the 3D-CRT map to pinpoint the cancer treatment field.

                    "body": "The most significant advantage of using 3D-CRT is that it helps your radiation oncology team target cancerous tumors while limiting radiation damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nWhile 3D-CRT is effective, studies suggest that intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) may kill cancerous cells and shrink tumors with fewer side effects than 3D-CRT. IMRT is another type of external beam radiation therapy. Like 3D-CRT, radiation oncology teams use scans to obtain a 3D view of cancerous tumors and nearby healthy tissue. The difference is how radiation is delivered.\nIn 3D-CRT, radiation is delivered in individual beams that target a tumor from different directions. In IMRT, plans call for delivering radiation in several smaller beams. Your radiation oncologist will recommend the radiation treatment plan that they believe is the best way to treat your condition.",

                    "body": "Three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) is one of the steps radiation oncologists use to plan cancer-killing radiation therapy. It\u2019s part of the detailed planning process that happens before you receive radiation therapy. Using this planning process helps your radiation oncologist target cancerous tumors while protecting nearby organs from radiation. If you\u2019re receiving radiation therapy for cancer treatment, don\u2019t hesitate to ask your radiation oncology team to explain the process so you know what to expect."
